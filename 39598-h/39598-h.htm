<h2>Asa Holmes<br />

or<br />

At the Cross-roads</h2>




<h2>Chapter I</h2>


<div class='cap'>THERE is no place where men
learn each other's little peculiarities
more thoroughly than in the
group usually to be found around the
stove in a country store. Such acquaintance
may be of slow growth,
like the oak's, but it is just as sure.
Each year is bound to add another ring
to one's knowledge of his neighbours
if he lounges with them, as man and
boy, through the Saturday afternoons
of a score of winters.</div>

<p>A boy learns more there than he
can be taught in schools. It may be
he is only a tow-headed, freckle-faced
little fellow of eight when he rides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
over to the cross-roads store for the
first time by himself. Too timid to
push into the circle around the fire, he
stands shivering on the outskirts, looking
about him with the alertness of a
scared rabbit, until the storekeeper
fills his kerosene can and thrusts the
weekly mail into his red mittens.
Then some man covers him with
confusion by informing the crowd that
"that little chap is Perkins's oldest,"
and he scurries away out of the embarrassing
focus of the public eye.</p>

<p>But the next time he is sent on the
family errands he stays longer and
carries away more. Perched on the
counter, with his heels dangling over
a nail keg, while he waits for the belated
mail train, he hears for the first
time how the government ought to be
run, why it is that the country is going
to the dogs, and what will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
hens lay in cold weather. Added to
this general information, he slowly
gathers the belief that these men
know everything in the world worth
knowing, and that their decisions on
any subject settle the matter for all
time.</p>

<p>He may have cause to change his
opinion later on, when his sapling acquaintance
has gained larger girth;
when he has loafed with them,
smoked with them, swapped lies and
spun yarns, argued through a decade
of stormy election times, and talked
threadbare every subject under the sun.
But now, in his callow judgment, he
is listening to the wit and wisdom of
the nation. Now, as he looks around
the overflowing room, where butter
firkins crowd the calicoes and crockery,
and where hams and saddles swing
sociably from the same rafter, as far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
his knowledge goes, this is the only
store in the universe.</p>

<p>Some wonder rises in his childish
brain as he counts the boxes of axle-grease
and the rows of shining new
pitchforks, as to where all the people
live who are to use so many things.
He has yet to learn that this one little
store that is such a marvel to him is
only a drop in the bucket, and that he
may travel the width of the continent,
meeting at nearly every mile-post that
familiar mixture of odours&mdash;coal oil,
mackerel, roasted coffee, and pickle
brine. And a familiar group of men,
discussing the same old subjects in the
same old way, will greet him at every
such booth he passes on his pilgrimage
through Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>Probably in after years Perkins's
oldest will never realise how much of
his early education has been acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
at that Saturday afternoon loafing-place,
but he will often find himself looking
at things with the same squint with
which he learned to view them
through 'Squire Dobbs's short-sighted
spectacles. Many a time he will find
that he has been unconsciously warped
by the prejudices he heard expressed
there, and that his opinions of life in
general and men in particular are the
outgrowth of those early conversations
which gave him the creed of his boyhood.</p>

<p>"Them blamed Yankees!" exclaims
one of these neighbourhood orators,
tilting his chair back against the
counter, and taking a vicious bite at
his plug of tobacco. "They don't
know no better than to eat cold bread
the year 'round!" And the boy, accepting
the statement unquestioningly,
stores away in his memory not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the remark, but all the weighty emphasis
of disgust which accompanied
the remark in the spitting of a mouthful
of tobacco juice. Henceforth his
idea of the menu north of the Mason
and Dixon line is that it resembles the
bill of fare of a penitentiary, and he
feels that there is something coldblooded
and peculiar about a people
not brought up on a piping hot diet of
hoe-cake and beaten biscuit.</p>

<p>In the same way the lad whose
opinions are being moulded in some
little corner grocery of a New England
village, or out where the roads cross on
the Western prairie, receives his prejudices.
It may be years before he finds
out for himself that the land of Boone
is not fenced with whiskey jugs and
feuds, and that the cap-sheaf on
every shock of wheat in its domain is
not a Winchester rifle.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>But these prejudices, popular at local
cross-roads, are only the side lines of
which every section carries its own
specialty. When it comes to staple
articles, dear to the American heart
and essential to its liberty and progress,
their standard of value is the same the
country over.</p>

<p>One useful lesson the youthful
lounger may learn here, if he can
learn it anywhere, and that is to be a
shrewd reader of men and motives.
Since staple characteristics in human
nature are repeated everywhere, like
staple dry goods and groceries, a thorough
knowledge of the group around
the stove will be a useful guide to
Perkins's oldest in forming acquaintances
later in life.</p>

<p>Long after he has left the little
hamlet and grown gray with the experiences
of the metropolis, he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
run across some queer Dick whose
familiar personality puzzles him. As
he muses over his evening pipe, suddenly
out of the smoke wreaths will
spring the face of some old codger
who aired his wisdom in the village
store, and he will recognise the likeness
between the two as quickly as he
would between two cans of leaf lard
bearing the same brand.</p>

<p>But Perkins's oldest is only in the
primer of his cross-roads curriculum
now, and these are some of the lessons
he is learning as he edges up to the
group around the fire. On the day
before Thanksgiving, for instance, he
was curled up on a box of soap behind
the chair of old Asa Holmes&mdash;Miller
Holmes everybody calls him, because
for nearly half a century his water-mill
ground out the grist of all that section
of country. He is retired now; gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
up his business to his grandsons. They
carry it on in another place with steam
and modern machinery, and he is laid
on the shelf. But he isn't a back
number, even if his old deserted mill
is. It is his boast that now he has
nothing else to do, he not only keeps
up with the times, but ahead of them.</p>

<p>Everybody goes to him for advice;
everybody looks up to him as they do
to a hardy old forest tree that's lived
through all sorts of hurricanes, but has
stood to the last, sturdy of limb, and
sound to the core. He is as sweet and
mellow as a winter apple, ripened in
the sun, and that's why everybody likes
to have him around. You don't see
many old men like that. Their troubles
sour them.</p>

<p>Well, this day before Thanksgiving
the old miller was in his usual place at
the store, and as usual it was he who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was giving the cheerful turn to the
conversation. Some of the men were
feeling sore over the recent election;
some had not prospered as they had
hoped with their crops, and were experiencing
the pinch of hard times and
sickness in their homes. Still there
was a holiday feeling in the atmosphere.
Frequent calls for nutmeg,
and sage, and cinnamon, left the air
spicy with prophecies of the morrow's
dinner.</p>

<p>The farmers had settled down for a
friendly talk, with the comfortable
sense that the crops were harvested,
the wood piled away for the winter,
and a snug, warm shelter provided for
the cattle. It was good to see the hard
lines relax in the weather-beaten faces,
in the warmth of that genial comradeship.
Even the gruffest were beginning
to thaw a little, when the door opened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and Bud Hines slouched in. The spirits
of the crowd went down ten degrees.</p>

<p>Not that he said anything; only gave
a gloomy nod by way of greeting as he
dropped into a chair. But his whole
appearance said it for him; spoke in
the droop of his shoulders, and the
droop of his hat brim, and the droop
of his mouth at the corners. He
looked as if he might have sat for the
picture of the man in the "Biglow
Papers," when he said:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Sometimes my innard vane pints east for weeks together,<br />
My natur' gits all goose-flesh, an' my sins<br />
Come drizzlin' on my conscience sharp ez pins."<br />
</div>

<p>The miller greeted him with the
twinkle in his eye that eighty years
and more have never been able to dim;
and Perkins's oldest had his first meeting
with the man who always finds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
screw loose in everything. Nothing
was right with Bud Hines. One of
his horses had gone lame, and his best
heifer had foundered, and there was
rust in his wheat. He didn't have any
heart to keep Thanksgiving, and he
didn't see how anybody else could,
with the bottom dropped clean out of
the markets and the new road tax so
high. For his part he thought that
everything was on its last legs, and it
wouldn't be long till all the Powers
were at war, and prices would go up
till a poor man simply couldn't live.</p>

<p>It was impossible not to be affected
more or less by his gloomy forebodings,
and the old miller, looking around
on the listening faces, saw them settling
back in their old discouraged lines.
Clasping his hands more firmly over
the top of his cane, he exclaimed:
"Now look here, Bud Hines, I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
going to give you a proverb that was
made on purpose for such a poor, weak-kneed
Mr. Ready-to-halt as you are:
'Never be discouraged, and never be a
discourager!' If you can't live up to
the first part, you certainly can to the
second. No matter how hard things
go with you, you've no right to run
around throwing cold water on other
people. What if your horse has gone
lame? You've got a span of mules
that can outpull my yoke of oxen
any day. One heifer oughtn't to send
a man into mourning the rest of his
days, and it would be more fitting to
be thankful over your good tobacco
crop than to groan over the failure of
your wheat. More fitting to the season.
As for the rest of the things
you're worrying over, why, man, they
haven't happened yet, and maybe never
will. My old grandad used to say to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
me when I was a lad, 'Never cross
your bridge till you come to it, Asa,'
and I've proved the wisdom of that
saying many a time. Suppose'n you
put that in your pipe and smoke it."</p>

<p>If Perkins's oldest learns no other
lesson this year than to put those two
proverbs into practice, he will have
had a valuable education. How many
Thanksgivings they will help to make
for him! How many problems and
perplexities they will solve!</p>

<p>"Never be discouraged; never be a
discourager! Don't cross your bridge
until you come to it!" It is a philosophy
that will do away with half the
ills which flesh imagines it is heir to.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day! How much
more it means to the old miller than
to the little fellow beside him on the
soap box! To the child it is only a
feast day; to the old man it is a festival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
that links him to a lifetime of sacred
memories.</p>

<p>"Five and eighty years," he says, musingly,
resting his chin on the wrinkled
hands that clasp the head of his cane.
A silence falls on the group around the
stove, and through the cracked door
the red firelight shines out on thoughtful
faces.</p>

<p>"It's a long time; five and eighty
years," he repeats, "and every one of
them crowned with a Thanksgiving.
Boys," lifting his head and looking
around him, "you've got a good bit
of pike to travel over yet before you
get as far as I've gone, and some of you
are already half fagged out and beginning
to wonder if it's all worth while&mdash;Bud,
here, for instance. I'd like to
give you all a word of encouragement.</p>

<p>"Looking back, I can see that I've
had as many ups and downs as any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
you, and more than your share of work
and trouble, for I've lived longer, and
nearly all the years are marked with
graves. Seems to me that lately I've
had to leave a new grave behind me at
every mile-stone, till now I'm jogging
on all alone. Family gone, old neighbours
gone, old friends&mdash;I'm the last
of the old set. But, still, when all is
said and done, I haven't lost heart, for
'I've lived, seen God's hand through a
lifetime, and all was for best.'</p>

<p>"When I was milling down there on
Bear Creek you'd 'a' thought I was a
fool if I hadn't taken my rightful toll
out of every bushel of grist that ran
through my hopper, and sometimes I
think that the Almighty must feel that
way about us when we go on grinding
and grinding, and never stopping to count
up our share of the profit and pleasure
and be thankful over it. I believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
no matter what life pours into our hopper,
we are to grind some toll of good
out of it for ourselves, and as long as a
man does his part toward producing
something for the world's good, some
kind of bread for its various needs, he
will never go hungry himself.</p>

<p>"And I believe more than that.
You've heard people compare old age
to a harvest field, and talk about the
autumn of life with its ripened corn
waiting for the reaper Death, and all
that, and speak about the 'harvest
home,' as if it were the glorious end
of everything. But it never did strike
me that way, boys. The best comes
after the harvesting, when the wheat
is turned into flour and the flour into
bread, and the full, wholesome loaves go
to make up blood and muscle and brain.
That's giving it a sort of immortality,
you might say, raising it into a higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
order of life. And it's the same with
a man. His old age is just a ripening
for something better a little further on.
All that we go through with here isn't
for nothing, and at eighty-five, when
it looks as if a man had come to the
stepping-off place, I've come to believe
that 'the best is yet to be.'"</p>

<p>There is a stir around the door, and
the old miller looks around inquiringly.
The mail has come in, and he rises
slowly to get his weekly paper. Perkins's
oldest, waiting his turn in front
of the little case of pigeonholes, eyes
the old man with wondering side
glances. He has not understood more
than half of what he has heard, but he
is vaguely conscious that something is
speaking to him now, as he looks into
the tranquil old face. It is the miller's
past that is calling to him; all those
honest, hard-working years that show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
themselves in the bent form and
wrinkled hands; the serene peacefulness
that bespeaks a clear conscience;
the big, sunny nature that looks out
of those aged eyes; and above all the
great hopefulness that makes his days a
perpetual Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The mute eloquence of an unspoken
invitation thrills the child's heart, he
knows not why:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Grow old along with me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The best is yet to be!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>It is the greatest lesson that Perkins's
oldest can ever learn.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter II</h2>


<div class='cap'>ONE would have known that it
was the day before Christmas
at the Cross-Roads store, even
if the big life insurance calendar over
the desk had not proclaimed the fact
in bold red figures. An unwonted
bustle pervaded the place. Rows of
plump, dressed turkeys hung outside
the door, and on the end of the counter
where the pyramid of canned tomatoes
was usually stacked, a little
evergreen tree stood in a brave array
of tinsel and tiny Christmas tapers.</div>

<p>It was only an advertisement. No
one might hope to be the proud possessor
of the Noah's ark lodged in its
branches, or of the cheap toys and
candy rings dangling from every limb,
unless he had the necessary pennies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Still, every child who passed it eyed it
with such wistful glances that the little
rubber Santa Claus at the base must
have felt his elastic heart stretch almost
to bursting.</p>

<p>Above the familiar odour of coal-oil
and mackerel, new leather, roasted
coffee and pickle brine, rose the holiday
fragrance of cedar and oranges.</p>

<p>"Makes me think of when I was a
kid," said a drummer who had been
joking with the men around the stove,
trying to kill time while he waited for
the train that was to take him home
for Christmas. "There's nothing like
that smell of cedar and oranges to resurrect
the boy in a man. It puts me
straight back into knickerbockers again,
among a whole grove of early Christmas
trees. I'll never forget the way I
felt when I picked my first pair of
skates off one of them. A house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
lot wouldn't give me such a thrill
now."</p>

<p>"Aw, I don't believe Christmas is at
all what it's cracked up to be," said a
voice from behind the stove, in such
a gloomy tone that a knowing smile
passed around the circle.</p>

<p>"Bet on you, Bud Hines, for findin'
trouble, every time," laughed the storekeeper.
"Why, Bud, there ain't no
screw loose in Christmas, is there?"</p>

<p>"Well, there just is!" snapped the
man, resenting the laugh. "It comes
too often for one thing. I just wish
it had happened on leap-year, the
twenty-ninth of February. It would
be a heap less expensive having it just
once in four years. Seems to me we're
always treading on its heels. My old
woman hardly gets done knitting tidies
for one Christmas till she's hard at it
for another.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anyhow, Christmas never measures
up to what you think it's a-going
to&mdash;not by a jug-full. Sure as you
get your heart set on a patent nail-puller
or a pair of fur gloves&mdash;something
that'll do <i>you</i> some good&mdash;your
wife gives you a carpet sweeper, or
an alarm-clock that rattles you out an
hour too early every morning."</p>

<p>The drummer led the uproarious
laughter that followed. They were
ready to laugh at anything in this season
of good cheer, and the drummer's
vociferous merriment was irresistible.
He slapped the speaker on the back,
adding jokingly, "That's one thing
Job never had to put up, did he, partner!
He nearly lost his reputation for
politeness over the misfit advice he
didn't want. But there's no telling
what he'd have done with misfit Christmas
gifts. It would take a star actor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to play the grateful for some of the
things people find in their stockings.
For instance, to have a fond female
relative give you a shaving outfit, when
you wear a full beard."</p>

<p>"You bet your life," answered the
storekeeper feelingly. "Now, if Santa
Claus wasn't a fake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hist!" said the drummer, with a
significant glance toward a small boy,
perched on a soap-box in their midst,
listening open-mouthed to every word.
"I've children myself, and I'd punch
anybody's head who would shake their
faith in Santy. It's one of the rosy
backgrounds of childhood, in my opinion,
and I've got a heap of happiness
out of it since I was a kid, too, looking
back and recollecting."</p>

<p>It was very little happiness that the
boy on the soap-box was getting out
of anything, that gray December afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
He was weighed down with a
feeling of age and responsibility that
bore heavily on his eight-year-old
shoulders. He had long felt the strain
of his position, as pattern to the house
of Perkins, being the oldest of five.
Now there was another one, and to be
counted as the oldest of six pushed
him almost to the verge of gray hairs.</p>

<p>There was another reason for his
tear-stained face. He had been disillusioned.
Only that noon, his own
mother had done that for which the
drummer would have punched any
one's head, had it been done to his
children. "We're too poor, Sammy.
There can't be any Christmas at our
house this year," she had said, fretfully,
as she stopped the noisy driving of
nails into the chimney, on which he
contemplated hanging the fraternal
stockings. To his astonished "Why?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
she had replied with a few blunt truths
that sent him out from her presence,
shorn of all his childish hopefulness as
completely as Samson was shorn of his
strength.</p>

<p>There had been a sorry half-hour in
the hay-mow, where he snuffled over
his shattered faith alone, and from
whence he went out, a hardened little
skeptic, to readjust himself to a cold
and Santa Clausless world. The only
glimmer of comfort he had had since
was when the drummer, with a friendly
wink, slipped a nickel into his hand.
But even that added to his weight of
responsibility. He dropped it back
and forth from one little red mitten to
another, with two impulses strong upon
him. The first was to spend it for six
striped sticks of peppermint candy, one
for each stocking, and thus compel
Christmas to come to the house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Perkins. The other was to buy one
orange and go off in a corner and suck
it all by himself. He felt that fate
owed him that much of a reparation
for his disappointment. He was in
the midst of this inward debate when
a new voice joined the discussion
around the stove. It came from Cy
Akers.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I</i> think it's downright sinful
to stuff a child with such notions.
You may call 'em fairy-tales all you
like, but it's nothing more or less than
a pack of lies. The idea of a Christian
payrent sitting up and telling his immortal
child that a big fat man in
furs will drive through the air to-night
in a reindeer sleigh right over the roofs
and squeeze himself down a lot of
sooty chimneys, with a bag of gimcracks
on his back&mdash;it's all fol-de-rol!
I never could see how any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
intelligent young one could believe it.
I never did. But that's one thing about
me, as the poet says, 'If I've one pecooliar
feature it's a nose that won't be
led.' I never could be made to take
stock in any such nonsense, even as a
boy. I'll leave it to Mr. Asa Holmes,
here, if it isn't wrong to be putting
such ideas into the youth of our land."</p>

<p>The old miller ran his fingers through
his short white hair and looked around.
His smile was wholesome as it was
genial. He was used to being called
in judgment on these neighbourhood
discussions, and he spoke with the air
of one who felt that his words carried
weight:</p>

<p>"You're putting it pretty strong, Cy,"
he said, with a laugh, and then a tender,
reminiscent light gleamed in his old
eyes.</p>

<p>"You see it's this way with me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
boys. We never heard any of these
things when I was a lad. It's plain
facts in a pioneer cabin, you know.
Father taught us about Christmas in
the plain words that he found set down
in the Gospels, and I told it the same
way to my boys. When my first little
grandson came back to the old house
to spend Christmas, I thought it was
almost heathenish for his mother to
have him send letters up the chimney
and talk as if Santa Claus was some
real person. I told her so one day,
and asked what was going to happen
when the little fellow outgrew such
beliefs.</p>

<p>"'Why, Father Holmes,' said she,&mdash;I
can hear her now, words and tones,
for it set me to thinking,&mdash;'don't you
see that he is all the time growing into
a broader belief? It's this way.' She
picked up a big apple from the table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
'Once this apple was only a tiny seed-pod
in the heart of a pink blossom.
The beauty of the blossom was all that
the world saw, at first, but gradually,
as the fruit swelled and developed, the
pink petals fell off, naturally and easily,
and the growing fruit was left. My
little son's idea of Christmas is in the
blossom time now. This rosy glamour
of old customs and traditions that
makes it so beautiful to him is taking
the part of the pink petals. They will
fall away by and by, of their own accord,
for underneath a beautiful truth
is beginning to swell to fruitage. Santa
Claus is the Spirit of Christmas love
and giving, personified. It is because
I want to make it real and vital, something
that my baby's mind can grasp
and enjoy, that I incarnate it in the
form of the good old Saint Nicholas,
but I never let him lose sight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Star. It was the Spirit of Christmas
that started the wise men on their
search, and they followed the Star and
they found the Child, and laid gifts at
his feet. And when the Child was
grown, he, too, went out in the world
and followed the Star and scattered his
gifts of love and healing for all the
children of men. And so it has gone
on ever since, that Spirit of Christmas,
impelling us to follow and to find and
to give, wherever there is a need for
our gold and frankincense and myrrh.
That is the larger belief my boy is
growing into, from the smaller.'</p>

<p>"And she is right," said the old
man, after an impressive pause. "She
raised that boy to be an own brother
to Santa Claus, as far as good-will to
men goes. It's Christmas all the year
round wherever <i>he</i> is. And now when
he brings his boys back to the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
home and hangs their stockings up by
the fire, I never say a word. Sometimes
when the little chaps are hunting
for the marks of the reindeer hoofs
in the ashes, I kneel down on the old
hearthstone and hunt, too.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"A brother to Santa Claus!" The
phrase still echoed in the heart of
Perkins's oldest when the group around
the stove dispersed. It was that which
decided the fate of the nickel, and
filled the little red mittens with sticks
of striped delight for six, instead of the
lone orange for one. Out of a conversation
but dimly understood he had
gathered a vague comfort. It made
less difference that his patron saint was
a myth, since he had learned there
might be brothers in the Claus family
for him to fall back upon. Then his
fingers closed over the paper bag of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
peppermints, and, suddenly, with a little
thrill, he felt that in some queer way
he belonged to that same brotherhood.</p>

<p>As he fumbled at the latch, the old
miller, who always saw his own boyhood
rise before him in that small
tow-headed figure, and who somehow
had divined the cause of the tear-streaks
on the dirty little face, called
him. "Here, sonny!" It was a pair
of shining new skates that dangled
from the miller's hands into his.</p>

<p>One look of rapturous delight, and
two little feet were flying homeward
down the frozen pike, beating time to
a joy that only the overflowing heart
of a child can know, when its troubles
are all healed, and faith in mankind
restored. And the old man, going
home in the frosty twilight of the
Christmas eve, saw before him all the
way the light of a shining star.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter III</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was an hour past the usual time
for closing the Cross-Roads store,
but no one made a move to go.
Listening in the comfortable glow of
the red-hot stove, to the wind whistling
down the long pipe, was far pleasanter
than facing its icy blasts on the
way home. Besides, it was the last
night of the old year, and hints of
forthcoming cider had been dropped
by Jim Bowser, the storekeeper. Also
an odour of frying doughnuts came
in from the kitchen, whenever Mrs.
Bowser opened the door into the
entry.</div>

<p>Added to the usual group of loungers
was the drummer who had spent
Christmas eve with them. He had
come in on an accommodation train,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and was waiting for the midnight express.
He had had the floor for some
time with his stories, when suddenly
in the midst of the laughter which
followed one of his jokes, Bud Hines
made himself heard.</p>

<p>"I say, Jim," he exclaimed, turning
to the storekeeper, "why don't you
tear off the last leaf of that calendar?
We've come to the end of everything
now; end of the day, end of the year,
end of the century! Something none
of <i>us</i> will ever experience again. It's
always a mighty solemn thought to me
that I'm doing a thing for the la-ast
time!"</p>

<p>Jim laughed cheerfully, tilting his
chair back against the counter, and
thrusting his thumbs into the armholes
of his vest.</p>

<p>"I don't know as I feel any call to
mourn over takin' down an old calendar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
when I have a prettier one to
put in its place, and it's the same way
with the century. There'll be a better
one to begin on in the morning."</p>

<p>"That's so," asserted Cy Akers.
"But some people come bang up
against a New Year as if it was a stone
wall, and down they set and count up
their sins, and turn over new leaves,
and load 'emselves down with so many
good resolutions that they stick in the
mud by the end of the first week.
Now I hold that if it wasn't for the
almanacs, steppin' from one year to
another, or from one century to another,
wouldn't jar you no more than
steppin' over the equator. They're
only imaginary lines, and nobody would
ever know where he was at, either in
months or meridians, if he didn't have
almanacs and the like to keep him
posted. Fourth of July is just as good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
a time to take stock and turn over a
new leaf as the first of January."</p>

<p>"Maybe you take stock like a man
I used to sell to down in Henderson
County," said the drummer. "He
never kept any books, so he never
knew exactly where he was 'at,' as you
say. Once a year he'd walk around
the store with his hands in his pockets,
and size up things in a general sort of
way. 'Bill,' he'd say to his clerk,
cocking his eyes up at the shelves,
'we've got a right smart chance of
canned goods left over. I reckon
there's a half shelf full more than we
had left last year. I know there's
more bottles of ketchup.' Then he'd
take another turn around the room.
'Bill, I disremember how many pitchforks
we had in this rack. There's
only two left now. Nearly all the
calico is sold, and (thumping the molasses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
barrel), this here bar'l sounds like
it's purty nigh empty. Take it all
around, Bill, we've done first-rate this
year, so I don't know as it's worth
while botherin' about weighin' and
measurin' what's left over, so long as
we're satisfied.' And maybe that's why
Cy makes so little of New Year,"
added the drummer, with a sly wink
at the others. "He thinks it's not
worth while to weigh and measure his
shortcomings when he can take stock
of himself in a general sort of a way,
and always be perfectly satisfied with
himself."</p>

<p>There was a laugh at Cy's expense,
and Bud Hines began again.</p>

<p>"What worries me is, what's been
prophesied about the new century.
One would think we've had enough
famines and plagues and wars and
rumours of wars in this here old one to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
do for awhile, but from what folks say,
it ain't goin' to hold a candle to the
trouble we'll see in the next one."</p>

<p>"Troubles is seasonin'. ''Simmons
ain't good till they are frostbit,'" quoted
Cy.</p>

<p>"Then accordin' to Bud's tell, he
ought to be the best seasoned persimmon
on the bough," chuckled the
storekeeper.</p>

<p>"No, that fellow that was here this
afternoon goes ahead of Bud," insisted
Cy, turning to the drummer. "I wish
you could have heard him, pardner.
He came in to get a postal order for
some money he wanted to send in a
letter, and he nearly wiped up the earth
with poor old Bowser, because there
was a two-cent war tax to pay on it.</p>

<p>"'Whose war?' says he. ''Tain't
none of <i>my</i> makin',' says he, 'and I'll
be switched if I'll pay taxes on a thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I've been dead set against from the
start. It's highway robbery,' says he,
'to load the country down with a war
debt in times like these. It's kill
yourself to keep yourself these days,
and as my Uncle Josh used to say after
the Mexican war, "it's tough luck
when people are savin' and scrimpin'
at the spigot for the government to be
drawin' off at the bung."'</p>

<p>"Bowser here just looked him over
as if he'd been a freak at a side-show,
and said Bowser, in a dry sort of way,
he guessed, 'when it came to the pinch,
the spigot wouldn't feel that a two-cent
stamp was a killin' big leakage.'</p>

<p>"The fellow at that threw the coppers
down on the counter, mad as a
hornet. 'It's the principle of the
thing,' says he. 'Uncle Sam had no
business to bite off more'n he could
chew and then call on me to help.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
What's the war done for this country,
anyhow?'</p>

<p>"He was swinging his arms like a
stump speaker at a barbecue, by this
time. 'What's it done?' says he.
'Why it's sent the soldiers back from
Cuba with an itch as bad as the smallpox,
and as ketchin' to them citizens
that wanted peace, as to them that
clamoured for war. I know what I'm
talkin' about, for my hired man like to
'uv died with it, and he hadn't favoured
the war any more than a spring lamb.
And what's it doin' for us, now?' says
he. 'Sendin' the poor fellows back
from the Philippines by the ship-load,
crazy as June-bugs. I know what I'm
talkin' about. That happened to one
of my wife's cousins. What was it
ever begun for,' says he, 'tell me
that!'</p>

<p>"Peck here, behind the stove, sung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
out like a fog-horn, '<i>Remember the
Maine!</i>' Peck knew what a blow the
fellow had made at an indignation
meeting when the news first came.
No tellin' what would have happened
then if a little darky hadn't put his
head in at the door and yelled, 'Say,
mistah, yo' mules is done backed yo'
wagon in de ditch!' He tore out to
tend to them, or we might have had
another Spanish war right here among
Bowser's goods and chattels."</p>

<p>"No danger," said Peck, dryly,
"he isn't the kind of a fellow to fight
for principle. It's only when his
pocketbook is touched he wants to
lick somebody. He's the stingiest man
I ever knew, and I've known some
mighty mean men in my time."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you all to-night?"
said the drummer. "You're
the most pessimistic crowd I've struck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in an age. This is the tune you've
been giving me from the minute I
lifted the latch." And beating time
with foot and hands in old plantation
style, the drummer began forthwith to
sing in a deep bass voice that wakened
the little Bowsers above:</p>

<p>The door into the entry opened a
crack and Mrs. Bowser's forefinger
beckoned.</p>

<p>"Here's good-bye to the old and
good luck to the new," cried Jim,
jumping up to take the big pitcher of
cider that she passed through the opening.</p>

<p>"And here's to Mrs. Bowser," cried
the drummer, taking the new tin cup
filled for him with the sparkling cider,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and helping himself to a hot doughnut
from the huge panful which she
brought in. "It's a pretty good sort
of world, after all, that gives you cakes
as crisp and sugary as these. 'Speak
well of the bridge that carries you
over' is my motto, so don't let another
fellow cheep to-night, unless he can
say something good of the poor old
century or the men who've lived in
it!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Holmes! Mr. Asa Holmes!"
cried several voices.</p>

<p>The old miller, who had been silent
all evening, straightened himself up in
his chair and drew his hand over his
eyes.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I were parting with an
old comrade, to-night," he said. "The
century had only fifteen years the start
of me, and it's a long way we've travelled
together. I've been sitting here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
thinking how much we've lived
through. Listen, boys."</p>

<p>It was a brief series of pictures he
drew for them, against the background
of his early pioneer days. They saw
him, a little lad, trudging more than
a mile on a winter morning to borrow
a kettle of hot coals, because the fire
had gone out on his own hearthstone,
and it was before the days of matches.
They saw him huddled with the other
little ones around his mother's knee
when the wolves howled in the night
outside the door, and only the light
of a tallow-dip flickered through the
darkness of the little cabin. They saw
the struggle of a strong life against
the limitations of the wilderness, and
realised what the battle must have been
oftentimes, against sudden disease and
accident and death, with the nearest
doctor a three days' journey distant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
no smoke from any neighbour's chimney
rising anywhere on all the wide
horizon.</p>

<p>While he talked, a heavy freight
train rumbled by outside; the wind
whistled through the telegraph wires.
The jingle of a telephone bell interrupted
his reminiscences. The old
man looked up with a smile. "See
what we have come to," he said, "from
such a past to a time when I can say
'hello,' across a continent. Cables and
cross-ties and telegraph poles have annihilated
distance. The century and I
came in on an ox-cart; we are going
out on a streak of lightning.</p>

<p>"But that's not the greatest thing,"
he said, pausing, while the listening
faces grew still more thoughtful.
"Think of the hospitals! The homes!
The universities! The social settlements!
The free libraries! The humane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
efforts everywhere to give humanity
an uplift! When I think of all this
century has accomplished, of the heroic
lives it has produced, I haven't a word
to say about its mistakes and failures.
After all, how do we know that the
things we cry out against <i>are</i> mistakes?</p>

<p>"This war may be a Samson's riddle
that we are not wise enough to read.
Those who shall come after us may be
able to say '<i>Out of the eater came forth
meat, and out of the strong came forth
sweetness!</i>'"</p>

<p>Somewhere in an upper room a clock
struck twelve, and deep silence fell on
the little company as they waited for
the solemn passing of the century. It
was no going out as of some decrepit
Lear tottering from his throne. Perhaps
no man there could have put it in
words, but each one felt that its majestic
leave-taking was like the hoary old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
apostle's: "I have fought a good fight,
I have finished my course, I have kept
the faith."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter IV</h2>


<div class='cap'>FOR some occult reason, the successful
merchant in small towns
and villages is the confidant, if
not father-confessor, of a large number
of his patronesses. It may be that his
flattering air of personal interest, assumed
for purely business purposes,
loosens not only the purse-strings but
the spring that works the panorama
of private affairs. Or it may be an
idiosyncrasy of some classes of the
mind feminine, to make no distinction
between a bargain counter and a
confessional. Whatever the cause,
many an honest merchant can testify
that it is no uncommon thing for a
woman to air her domestic troubles
while she buys a skirt braid, or to
drag out her family skeleton with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sample of sewing silk she wishes to
match.</div>

<p>The Cross-Roads had had its share
of confidences, although as a rule the
women who disposed of their butter
and eggs in trade to Bowser were of
the patient sort, grown silent under
the repressing influence of secluded
farm life. Still, Bowser, quick to see
and keen to judge, had gained a remarkable
insight into neighbourhood
affairs in fifteen years' dealings with his
public. "All things come to him who
waits" if he wears an air of habitual
interest and has a sympathetic way of
saying "Ah! indeed!"</p>

<p>It was with almost the certainty of
foreknowledge that Bowser counted
his probable patrons as he spread out his
valentines on the morning of the fourteenth
of February. He had selected
his comic ones with a view to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
feud that existed between the Hillock
and Bond families, well knowing
that a heavy cross-fire of ugly caricatures
and insulting rhymes would be
kept up all day by the younger members
of those warring households. It
was with professional satisfaction he
smiled over the picture of a fat man
with a donkey's head, which he was
as sure would be sent by Pete Hillock
to old man Bond, as if he had heard
Pete's penny dropping into the cash-drawer.</p>

<p>"Nothing like supplying the demand,"
he chuckled.</p>

<p>It was with more than professional
interest that he arranged the lace-paper
valentines in the show-case, for the
little embossed Cupids had a strong
ally in this rustic haberdasher, whose
match-making propensities had helped
many a little romance to a happy issue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Drawing on his fund of private information,
acquired in his rle of confidant
to the neighbourhood gossips, he
set out his stock of plump red hearts,
forget-me-nots, and doves; and with
each addition to the festal array he
nodded his head knowingly over the
particular courtship it was designed to
speed, or the lovers' quarrel that he
hoped might be ended thereby.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There had been two weeks of "February
thaw." Melting snow had made
the mud hub-deep in places. There
was a velvety balminess in the touch
of the warm wind, and faint, elusive
odours, prophetic of spring, rose from
the moist earth and sap-quickened trees.</p>

<p>The door of the Cross-Road store
stood open, and behind it, at the post-office
desk, sat Marion Holmes, the
old miller's granddaughter. Just out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of college and just into society, she had
come to spend Lent in the old place
that had welcomed her every summer
during her childhood. The group
around the stove stared covertly at the
pretty girl in the tailor-made gown,
failing to recognise in the tall, stylish
figure any trace of the miller's "little
Polly," who used to dangle her feet
from the counter and munch peppermint
drops, while she lisped nursery
rhymes for their edification.</p>

<p>She had come for the letters herself,
she told Bowser, because she was expecting
a whole bag full, and her
grandfather's rheumatism kept him at
home. Installed in the post-office
chair, behind the railing that enclosed
the sanctum of pigeon-holes, she amused
herself by watching the customers while
she waited for the mail-train.</p>

<p>"It's like looking into a kaleidoscope,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
she told Bowser in one of the
pauses of trade. "Every one who
comes in gives me a different point
of view and combination of opinions.
Now, those valentines! I was thinking
what old-fashioned things those
little lace-paper affairs are, and wondering
how anybody could possibly get
up any thrills over them, when in
walked Miss Anastasia Dill. Prim and
gentle as ever, isn't she? Still getting
her styles from <i>Godey's Lady's Books</i> of
the early sixties; she must draw on
their antiquated love stories for her
sentiment, too, for she seemed lost in
admiration of those hearts and darts.
What <i>do</i> you suppose is Miss Anastasia's
idea of a lover?"</p>

<p>Marion rattled on with all of a dbutante's
reckless enthusiasm for any
subject under discussion. "Wouldn't
he be as odd and old-fashioned as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
lace valentines themselves? She'd call
him a <i>suitor</i>, wouldn't she? I wonder
if she ever had one."</p>

<p>Then Bowser, piecing together the
fragmentary gossip of fifteen years, told
Marion all he knew of Miss Anastasia's
gentle romance; and Marion, idly
clasping and unclasping the little Yale
pin on her jacket, gained another peep
into the kaleidoscope of human experiences.</p>

<p>"I have read of such devotion to a
memory," she said when the story was
done, "but I never met it in the flesh.
What a pity he died while he was on
such a high pedestal in her imagination.
If he had lived she would have
discovered that there are no such paragons,
and all the other sons of Adam
needn't have suffered by comparison.
So she's an old maid simply because
she put her ideal of a lover so high in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the clouds nobody could live up to it!
Dear old Miss Anastasia!"</p>

<p>Bowser pulled his beard. "Such
couples make me think of these here
lamps with double wicks," he said.
"They hardly ever burn along together
evenly. One wick is sure to flare up
higher than the other; you either have
to keep turning it down and get along
with a half light or let it smoke the
chimney&mdash;maybe crack it&mdash;and make
things generally uncomfortable. But
here comes somebody, Miss Marion,
who's burned along pretty steady, and
that through three administrations. It's
her brag that she's had three husbands
and treated them just alike, even to the
matter of tombstones. 'Not a pound
difference in the weight nor a dollar in
the price,' she always says."</p>

<p>The newcomer was a fat, wheezy
woman, spattered with mud from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
hem of her skirt to the crown of her
big crape bonnet, which had tipped
on one side with the jolting of the
wagon.</p>

<p>"Well, Jim Bowser!" she exclaimed,
catching sight of the valentines.
"Ef you ain't got out them
silly, sentimental fol-de-rols again! My
nephew, Jason Potter,&mdash;that's my second
husband's sister's son, you know,&mdash;spent
seventy-five cents last year to buy
one of them silly things to send to his
girl; and I says to him, 'Jason,' says I,
'ef <i>I'd</i> been Lib Meadows, that would
'uv cooked your goose with <i>me!</i> Any
man simple enough to waste his substance
so, wouldn't make a good provider.'
I ought to know&mdash;I've been
a wife three times."</p>

<p>This, like all other of Mrs. Power's
conversational roads, led back to the
three tombstones, and started a flow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of good-natured badinage on the subject
of matrimony, which continued
long after she had taken her noisy
departure. "Well!" exclaimed Bud
Hines, as the big crape bonnet went
jolting down the road, "I guess there's
three good men gone that could tell
why heaven is heaven."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Cy Akers.</p>

<p>"Because there's no marryin' or
givin' in marriage there."</p>

<p>"Bud speaks feelingly!" said Cy,
winking at the others. "He'd better
get a job on a newspaper to write Side
Talks with Henpecked Husbands."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't think <i>you'd</i> want to hear
any extrys or supplements," retorted
Bud. "You get enough in your own
daily editions."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"St. Valentine has been generous
with my little Polly," said the old miller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
looking up fondly at the tall, graceful
girl, coming into his room, her face
aglow and her arms full of packages.</p>

<p>"But what's the good of it all,
grandfather?" answered Marion. "I've
been looking into Cupid's kaleidoscope
through other people's eyes this afternoon,
and nothing is rose-coloured
as I thought. Everything is horrid.
'Marriage is a failure,' and sentiment
is a silly thing that people make flippant
jokes about, or else break their
hearts with, like Mr. Bowser's double-wick
lamps, that flare up and crack
their chimneys. I've come to the conclusion
that St. Valentine has outlived
his generation."</p>

<p>She broke the string which bound
one of the boxes that she had dropped
on the table, and took out a great dewy
bunch of sweet violets. As their fragrance
filled the room, the old man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
looked around as if half expecting to
see some familiar presence; then
dropped his white head with a sigh,
and gazed into the embers on the
hearth, lost in a tender reverie.</p>

<p>Presently he said, "I wish you would
hand me that box on my wardrobe
shelf, little girl." As Marion opened
the wardrobe door, something hanging
there made her give a little start of
surprise. It was an old familiar gray
dress, with the creases still in the bent
sleeves just as they had been left when
the tired arms last slipped out of them.
That was ten years ago; and Marion,
standing there with a mist gathering
in her eyes, recalled the day her grandfather
had refused to let any one fold
it away. It had hung there all those
years, the tangible reminder of the
strong, sweet presence that had left its
imprint on every part of the household.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is like my life since she slipped
out of it," the old man had whispered,
smoothing the empty sleeve with his
stiff old fingers. "Like my heart&mdash;set
to her ways at every turn, and left just
as she rounded it out&mdash;but now&mdash;so
empty!"</p>

<p>He lifted an old dog-eared school-book
from the box that Marion brought
him, a queer little "Geography and
Atlas of the Heavens," in use over fifty
years ago. Inside was a tiny slip of
paper, time-yellowed and worn. The
ink was faded, until the words written
in an unformed girlish hand were
barely legible:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"True as grapes grow on a vine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I will be your Valentine."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I had put a letter into her Murray's
grammar," he explained, holding up
another little book. "Here is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
page, just at the conjugation of the
verb 'to love.' You see I was a big,
shy, overgrown boy that lost my tongue
whenever I looked at her, although
she wasn't fifteen then, and only reached
my shoulder. This valentine was the
answer that she slipped into my atlas
of the heavens. I thought the sky
itself had never held such a star. We
walked home across the woodland together
that day, never saying a word.
It was the last of the February thaw,
and the birds were twittering as if it
were really spring. Just such a day as
this. All of a sudden, right at my feet,
I saw something smiling up at me, blue
as the blue of my Polly's eyes. I
stooped and brushed away the leaves,
and there were two little violets.</p>

<p>"As I gave them to her I wanted to
say, 'There will always be violets in
my heart for you, my Polly,' but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
couldn't speak a word. I know she
understood, for long years after&mdash;when
she was dead&mdash;I found them here.
She had pinned them on the page
where my letter had lain, here on the
conjugation that says, 'we love,' and
she had added the word '<i>for ever</i>.'"</p>

<p>A tear dropped on the dead violets
as the old man reverently closed the
book, and sat gazing again into the
dying embers. There was a tremulous
smile on his face. Was it backward
over the hills of their youth he was
wandering, or ahead to those heights
of Hope, where love shall "put on
immortality?"</p>

<p>Marion laid her warm cheek against
her violets, still fragrant with the sweetness
of their fresh, unfaded youth.
Then taking a cluster from the great
dewy bunch, she fastened it at her
throat with the little Yale pin.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter V</h2>


<div class='cap'>TRADE was dull at the Cross-Roads.
Jim Bowser, his hands
thrust into his pockets and his
lips puckered to a whistle, stood looking
through the dingy glass of his front
door. March was coming in with a
snow-storm, and all he could see in
any direction was a blinding fall of
white flakes. There were only three
men behind the stove that afternoon,
and one of them was absorbed in a
newspaper. Conversation flagged, and
from time to time Bud Hines yawned
audibly.</div>

<p>"This is getting to be mighty monotonous,"
remarked the storekeeper,
glancing from the falling snow to the
silent group by the stove.</p>

<p>"March always is," answered Bud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Hines. "The other months have
some holiday in 'em; something to
brighten 'em up, if it's no more than
a family birthday. But to me, March
is as dull and uninteresting as a mud
road."</p>

<p>"There's the inauguration this year,"
suggested Cy Akers, looking up from
his newspaper. "That's a big event.
This paper is full of it."</p>

<p>"Well, now you've hit it!" exclaimed
Bud, with withering scorn, as
he bit off another chew of tobacco.
"That is exciting! Just about as interesting
as watching a man take his
second helping of pie. I wouldn't go
across the road to see it. Now in a
monarchy, where death makes the
changes, it can't get to be a cut and
dried affair that takes place every four
years. They make a grand occasion
of it, too, with their pomp and ceremony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Look at what England's just
seen. It's the sight of a lifetime to
bury a queen and crown a king. But
what do we see when we change Presidents?
One man sliding into a chair
and another sliding out, same as when
the barber calls 'Next!' Humph!"</p>

<p>Cy Akers rubbed his chin. "Fuss
and feathers! That's all it amounts
to," he exclaimed. "I'm down on
monopolies, and in my opinion it's the
worst kind of monopoly to let one
family crowd out everybody else in the
king business. I like a country where
every man in it has a show. Not that
I'd <i>be</i> President, if they offered me
double the salary, but it is worth a
whole lot to me to feel that in case I
did want the office, I've as good a right
to it as any man living. And talk
about sights&mdash;I say it's the sight of a
lifetime to see a man step out from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
place among the people, anywhere he
happens to be when they call his name,
take his turn at ruling as if he'd been
born to it, and then step back as if
nothing had happened."</p>

<p>Bud smiled derisively. "You only
see that on paper, my boy. Men
don't step quietly into offices in this
country. They run for 'em till they
are red in the face, and it's the best
runner that gets there, not the best
man. Monopoly in the king business
keeps out the rabble, any how, and it
gives a country a good deal more dignity
to be ruled by a dynasty than by
Tom, Dick, and Harry."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no strings tied to
you," said Cy, testily, taking up his
newspaper again. "When people don't
like the way things are run on this
side of the water, there's nothing to
hinder emigration."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a stamping of snowy feet
outside the door, and a big, burly fellow
blustered in, whom they hailed as
Henry Bicking. He was not popular
at the Cross-Roads, having the unenviable
reputation of being a "born
tease," but any diversion was welcome
on such a dull day.</p>

<p>In the catalogue of queer characters
which every neighbourhood possesses,
the Autocrat, Bore, and Crank may take
precedence of all others alphabetically,
but the one that heads the list in disagreeableness
is that infliction on society
known as the "born tease." One
can forgive the teasing propensity
universally found in boys, as he would
condone the playful destructiveness of
puppyhood; something requiring only
temporary forbearance. But when that
trait refuses to be put away with childish
things it makes of the man it dominates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a sort of human mosquito. He
regards every one in reach his lawful
prey, from babies to octogenarians, and
while he does not always sting, the persistency
of his annoying attacks becomes
exasperating beyond endurance.</p>

<p>The same motive that made Henry
Bicking pull cats' whiskers out by the
roots when he was a boy, led him to
keep his children in a turmoil, and his
sensitive little wife in tears half the
time. He had scarcely seated himself
by the stove when he was afforded
opportunity for his usual pastime by
the entrance of half a dozen children,
who came tumbling in on their way
home from school to warm.</p>

<p>He began with a series of those
inane questions by which grown people
have made themselves largely responsible
for the pertness of the younger
generation. If children of this day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
have departed from that delectable
state wherein they were seen and not
heard, the fault is due far more to their
elders than to them. Often they have
been made self-conscious, and forced
into saucy self-assertion by the teasing
questions that are asked merely to provoke
amusing replies.</p>

<p>Henry Bicking's quizzing had an
element of cruelty in it. His was the
kind that pinches his victims' ears, that
tickles to the verge of agony, that
threatens all sorts of disagreeable things,
for the sake of seeing little faces blanch
with fright, or eyes fill with tears of
pain.</p>

<p>"Come here, Woodpecker," he began,
reaching for a child whose red
hair was the grief of his existence.
But the boy deftly eluded him, and
the little fellow standing next in line,
drying his snowball-soaked mittens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
became the victim. He was dragged
unwillingly to his tormentor's knee.</p>

<p>"What are you going to be when
you're a man?" was demanded, when
the first questions had elicited the fact
that the child's name was Sammy Perkins,
and that he was eight years old.
But Perkins's oldest, having no knowledge
of the grammar of life beyond its
present tense indicative, hung his head
and held his tongue at mention of its
future potential.</p>

<p>"If you don't tell me you sha'n't
have your mittens!" Bicking dangled
them tantalisingly out of reach, until,
after an agonising and unsuccessful
scramble, the child was forced into a
tearful reply.</p>

<p>Then he began again: "Which are
you for, Democrats or Republicans?"</p>

<p>"Ain't for neither."</p>

<p>"Well, you're the littlest mugwump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
I ever did see. Mugwumps ain't got
any right to wear mittens. I've a
notion to pitch 'em in the stove."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>don't!</i>" begged the child.
"<i>Please</i>, mister! I'm not a mugwump!"</p>

<p>The tragic earnestness of the child
as he disclaimed all right to the term
of reproach which he could not understand,
yet repudiated because of its
obnoxious sound, amused the man
hugely. He threw back his head and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Tell me who you holler for!" he
continued, catching him up and holding
him head downward a moment.
Then goaded by more teasing questions
and a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'threatenin'">threatening</ins> swing of his
red mittens toward the stove door,
Perkins's oldest was at last led to take
a bold stand on his party platform, and
publicly declare his political preference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
But it was in a shaking voice and between
frightened sobs.</p>

<p>"M-ma, she's for McKinley, an'
p-pap, he's for B-Bryan, so I jus' holler
for Uncle Sam!"</p>

<p>"Good enough for you, sonny,"
laughed the storekeeper. "That's true
blue Americanism. Stick to Uncle
Sam and never mind the parties.
They've had new blades put on their
old handles, and new handles put on
those old blades again, till none of 'em
are what we started out with. We
keep on calling them 'genuine Barlows,'
but it's precious little of the
original Barlows we're hanging on to
nowadays."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a woman's voice that interrupted
the conversation. Mrs. Teddy
Mahone had come in for some tea.</p>

<p>"Arrah, Misther Bicking! Give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
bye his mitts! You're worrse than a
cat with a mouse."</p>

<p>The loud voice with its rich Irish
brogue drew Cy Akers's attention from
his newspaper. "By the way, Bud,"
he exclaimed, raising his voice so that
Mrs. Mahone could not fail to hear,
"you were complaining about March
being so dull and commonplace without
any holidays. You've forgotten
St. Patrick's Day."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. St. Patrick is nothing
to me. There's no reason I should
take any interest in him."</p>

<p>"And did you hear that, Mrs. Mahone,"
asked Henry Bicking, anxious
to start a war of words.</p>

<p>"Oh, Oi heard it, indade Oi did!"
she answered with a solemn shake of
the head. "It grieves the hearrt of me
to hear such ingratichude. There's
niver a sowl in all Ameriky but has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
cause to be grateful for what he's done
for this counthry."</p>

<p>"What's he ever done?" asked Bud,
skeptically. There was a twinkle in
Mrs. Mahone's eyes as she answered:</p>

<p>"It was this way. A gude while
back whin it was at the beginnin' iv
things, Ameriky said to herself wan
day, 'It's a graand pudding Oi'll be
afther makin' meself, by a new resait
Oi've just thought iv.' So she dips
into this counthry for wan set iv immygrants,
an' into another counthry for
another batch, and after a bit a foine
mess she had iv 'em. Dutch an' Frinch

<p>"'Then give me some,' siz she, an'
St. Pathrick, not loikin' to lave a leddy

sod and handed her a fair shprinklin'
of them as would act as both spice an'

<p>"'They'll saison the whole lot,' siz
he, 'an' there's light-heartedness enough

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late that night Bowser pushed his
ledger aside with a yawn, and got
down from his high stool to close the
store. As he counted the meagre contents
of the cash drawer, he reviewed
the day, whose minutes had been as
monotonous in passing as the falling
of the snowflakes outside. It had left
nothing behind it to distinguish it from
a hundred other days. The same old
faces! The same kind of jokes! The
same round of commonplace duties! A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
spirit of unrest seized him, that made
him chafe against such dreary monotony.</p>

<p>When he went to the door to put
up the shutters, the beauty of the
night held him a moment, and he
stood looking across the wide fields,
lying white in moonlight and snow.
Far down the road a lamp gleamed
from the window of an upper room in
the old miller's house, where anxious
vigil had been kept beside him for
hours. The crisis was passed now.
Only a little while before, the doctor
had stopped by to say that their old
friend would live. Down the track
a gleaming switch-light marked the
place where a wreck had been narrowly
averted that morning.</p>

<p>"And no telling how many other
misfortunes we've escaped to-day,"
mused Bowser. "Maybe if a light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
could be swung out for each one, folks
would see that the dull gray days when
nothing happens are the ones to be
most thankful for, after all."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter VI</h2>


<div class='cap'>APRIL sunshine of mid-afternoon
poured in through the open door
of the Cross-Roads. The usual
group of loungers had gathered around
the rusty stove. There was no fire in
it; the day was too warm for that,
but force of habit made them draw
their chairs about it in a circle, as if
this common centre were the hub,
from which radiated the spokes of all
neighbourly intercourse.</div>

<p>The little schoolmistress was under
discussion. Her short reign in District
No. 3 had furnished a topic of conversation
as inexhaustible as the weather,
for her rgime was attended by startling
changes. Luckily for her, the young
ideas enjoyed being taught to shoot at
wide variance from the targets set up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
by parental practice and tradition, else
the tales told out of school might have
aroused more adverse criticism than
they did.</p>

<p>"You can't take much stock in her
new-fangled notions," was the unanimous
opinion at the Cross-Roads. She
had "put the cart before the horse"
when she laid the time-honoured alphabet
on the shelf, and gave the primer
class a whole word at a mouthful, before
it had cut a single orthographic
tooth on such primeval syllables as
a-b ab.</p>

<p>"Look at my Willie," exclaimed
one of the district fathers. "Beating
around the bush with talk about a picture
cow, and a real cow, and a word
cow, and not knowing whether B comes
after W or X. At his age I could say
the alphabet forwards or backwards as
fast as tongue could go without a slip."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's done <i>one</i> sensible thing," admitted
Cy Akers. "They tell me
she's put her foot down on the scholars
playing April fool tricks this year."</p>

<p>"I don't see why," said Henry Bicking.
"It has been one of the customs
in this district since the schoolhouse
was built. What's the harm if the
children do take one day in the year
for a little foolishness? Let them have
their fun, I say."</p>

<p>"But they've carried it too far," was
the answer. "It's scandalous they
should be allowed to abuse people's
rights and feelings and property as
they have done the last few years.
First of April doesn't justify such cutting
up any more than the first of
August."</p>

<p>"She's got Scripture on her side,"
said Squire Dobbs. "You know Solomon
says, 'As a mad man who casteth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
firebrands, arrows, and death, so is the
man that deceiveth his neighbour and
saith, am I not in sport?'"</p>

<p>"She can't stamp out such a deep-rooted
custom in one day," protested
Bicking.</p>

<p>"You can bet on the little school-ma'am
every time," laughed Bowser.
"My daughter Milly says they didn't
have regular lessons yesterday afternoon.
She had them put their books in their
desks.</p>

<p>"Said they'd been studying about
wise men all their lives, now they'd
study about fools awhile; the fools of
Proverbs and the fools of history.</p>

<p>"She read some stories, too, about a
cruel disappointment and the troubles
brought about by some thoughtless
jokes on the first of April. Mighty
interesting stories, Milly said. You
could have heard a pin drop, and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of the girls cried. Then she drew a
picture on the blackboard of a court
jester, in cap and bells, and asked if
they wouldn't like a change this year.
Instead of everybody acting the fool
and doing silly things they'd all be
ashamed of if they'd only stop to think,
wouldn't they rather she'd appoint just
one scholar to play the fool for all of
them, as the old kings used to do.</p>

<p>"They agreed to that, quick enough,
thinking what fun they'd have teasing
the one chosen to be it. Then she
said she'd appoint the first one this
morning who showed himself most
deserving of the office. Milly says
from the way she smiled when she said
it, they're all sure she means to choose
the first one who plays an April Fool
joke. She'd put it so strong to 'em
how silly it was, that there ain't a
child in school you could hire to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the risk of being appointed fool for the
day. So I think she's coming out
ahead as usual."</p>

<p>"After all," said Bud Hines, "there's
some lessons to be got out of those old
tricks we used to play. For instance,
the pocketbook tied to a string. Seems
to me that everything in life worth
having has a string tied to it, and just
as I am about to pick it up, Fate
snatches it out of my hands."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it, Buddy," said
Bowser, cheerfully; "you take notice
those pocketbooks on strings are always
empty ones, and they don't
belong to us, so we have no business
grabbing for them or feeling disappointed
because we can't get something
for nothing."</p>

<p>But Bud waved aside the interruption
mechanically.</p>

<p>"Then there's the <i>gifts</i> with strings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
tied to 'em," he continued. "My wife
has a rich aunt who is always sending her
presents, and writing, 'Understand this
is for <i>you</i>, Louisy. You're too generous,
and I don't want anybody but your
own deserving self to wear this.' Now
out in the country here, my wife
doesn't have occasion to wear handsome
clothes like them once a year,
while they'd be the very thing for
Clara May, off at Normal School. But
not a feather or a ribbon can the child
touch because her great-aunt bought
them expressly for her ma. Goodness
knows she'd have a thousand times
more pleasure in seeing Clara May
enjoy them, than knowing they were
lying away in bureau drawers doing
nobody any good. When she takes
'em out at house-cleaning times I say,
'Ma,' says I, 'deliver me from gifts
with strings tied to 'em. I'd rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
have a ten-cent bandanna, all mine, to
have and to hold or to give away as
pleased me most, than the finest things
your Aunt Honigford's money could
buy, if I had to account to her every
time I turned around in them.'</p>

<p>"When I give anything I <i>give</i> it,
and don't expect to come back, spying
around ten years afterward to see if
it's worn out, or cracked, or faded, or
broken. That's my doctrine."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Marion Holmes, driving along the
country road in the old miller's antiquated
chaise, drew rein in front of a
low picket gate, overhung by mammoth
snowball bushes. Down the path, between
the rows of budding lilacs and
japonicas, came an old gentleman in a
quaintly cut, long-tailed coat. He was
stepping along nimbly, although he
leaned hard on his gold-headed cane.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"'A man he was to all the country
dear,'" quoted Marion softly to herself
as the minister's benign face smiled
a greeting through his big square-bowed
spectacles. "I know he must
have been Goldsmith's friend, and I
wish I dared ask him how long he
lived in the Deserted Village." But
all she called out to him as he stopped
with a courtly bow, under the snowball
bushes, was a cheery good morning
and an invitation to take a seat beside
her if he wanted to drive to the Cross-Roads
store.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Polly," he answered,
"that is my destination. I am
on my way there for a text."</p>

<p>"For a what?" exclaimed Marion
in surprise, turning the wheel for him
to step in beside her.</p>

<p>"For a text for my Easter sermon,"
he explained as they drove on in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
warm April sunshine. "Ah, I see,
Miss Polly, you have not discovered the
school of philosophers that centres
around the Cross-Roads store. Well,
it's not to be wondered at; few people
do. I spent a winter in Rome, when
I was younger, and one of my favourite
walks was up on the Pincian Hill.
The band plays in the afternoons, you
know, and tourists flock to see the
queen drive by. There is a charming
view from the summit&mdash;the dome of
St. Peters against the blue Italian sky,
the old yellow Tiber crawling along
under its bridges from ruin to ruin,
and the immortal city itself, climbing
up its historic hills. And on the Pincio
one meets everybody,&mdash;soldiers and
courtiers, flower girls and friars, monks
in robes of every order, and pilgrims
from all parts of the world.</p>

<p>"The first time I was on the hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
as I wandered among the shrubbery and
flowers, I noticed a row of moss-grown
pedestals set along each side of the
drive for quite a distance. Each pedestal
bore the weather-beaten bust of
some old sage or philosopher or hero.</p>

<p>"They made no more impression
on my mind then, than so many
fence-posts, but later I found a workman
repairing the statuary one day.
He had put a new nose on the mutilated
face of an old philosopher, and
that fresh white nasal appendage, standing
out jauntily in the middle of the
ancient gray visage, was so ludicrous
I could not help smiling whenever I
passed it. I began to feel acquainted
with the old fellow, as day after day
that nose forced my attention. Sometimes,
coming upon him suddenly, the
only familiar face in a city full of
strangers, I felt that he was an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
friend to whom I should take off my
hat. Then it became so that I rarely
passed him without recalling some of
his wise sayings that I had read at college.
Many a time he and his row of
stony-eyed companions were an inspiration
to me in that way.</p>

<p>"It was so that I met these men at
the Cross-Roads. They scarcely claimed
my attention at first. Then one day
I heard one of them give utterance to
a time-worn truth in such an original
way that I stopped to talk to him.</p>

<p>"Trite as it was, he had hewn it
himself out of the actual experiences
of his own life. It was the result of
his own keen observation of human
nature. Set as it was in his homely,
uncouth dialect, it impressed me with
startling force. Then I listened to his
companions, and found that they, too,
were sometimes worthy of pedestals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Unconsciously to themselves they have
often given me suggestions for my sermons.
Ah, it's a pity that the backwoods
has no Pincio on which to give
its philosophers to posterity!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Half an hour later as they drove
homeward, Marion glanced at her companion.
"No text this time," she
laughed, breaking the reverie into
which the old minister had fallen.
"Your sages said nothing but 'good
morning, sir,' and there wasn't a single
suggestion of Easter in the whole store,
except the packages of egg dyes, and
some impossible little chocolate rabbits.
Oh, yes,&mdash;those two little boys playing
on the doorstep. Tommy Bowser had
evidently taken time by the forelock
and sampled his father's dyes, for he
had a whole hatful of coloured eggs,
and was teaching that little Perkins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
boy how to play 'bust.' He was an
apt scholar, for while I watched he
won five of Tommy's eggs and never
cracked his own. You should have
seen them."</p>

<p>"Oh, I saw them," said the minister,
with a smile. "It was those same
little lads who suggested the text for
my Easter sermon."</p>

<p>Marion gave a gasp of astonishment.
"Would you mind telling me <i>how?</i>"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It came about very naturally. There
they stood with their hands full of the
Easter eggs, with never a thought of
what they symbolised&mdash;the breaking
shell&mdash;the rising of this little embryo
earth-existence to the free full-winged
life of the Resurrection. They were
too intent on their little game, on their
small winnings and losings, to have a
thought for higher things. As I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
watched them it occurred to me how
typical it was of all the children of
men, and instantly that text from Luke
flashed into my mind: '<i>Their eyes were
holden.</i>' Do you remember? It was
when the two disciples went down to
Emmaus. I often picture it," mused the
old man after a little pause. "The green
of the olive groves, the red and white
of the blossoming almond-trees, the
late afternoon sunshine, and those two
discouraged fishermen trudging along
the dusty road. They were turning
away from a lost cause and a buried
hope, too absorbed in their overwhelming
grief to see that it was the risen
Lord Himself who walked beside them.
Not till the end of their journey did
they know why it was that their hearts
had burned within them as He talked
with them by the way. Their eyes
were holden.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"How typical that is, too, Miss
Polly. Sometimes we go on to the
end of life, missing the comfort and
help that we might have had at every
step, because we look up at our Lord
only through eyes of clay, and hold
communion with him as with a stranger.
Yes, I shall certainly make that the
subject of my Easter sermon, Miss
Polly. Thank you for helping me
discover it."</p>

<p>That next Sunday as Marion sat in
church beside the old miller, her gaze
wandered from the lilies in the chancel
to the faces of the waiting congregation.
Bud Hines was there and Bowser,
Cy Akers, and even Perkins's
oldest, whose game of "bust" had
suggested the helpful sermon of the
morning. Marion studied the serious,
weather-beaten faces with new interest.
"It is not in spiritual things alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that our eyes are holden," she said to
herself. "I have been looking at only
the commonplace exterior of these
people. It takes a man like the old
minister to recognise unpedestalled virtues
and to set them on the Pincio they
deserve."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter VII</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE old saying that "there are
always two sides to a story" has
worn a deep rut into the popular
mind. It has been handed down
to us so often with an air of virtuous
rebuke, that we have come to regard
the individual who insists on his two-sided
theory as the acme of all that is
broad-minded and tolerant. But in
point of fact, if two sides is all he sees,
he is only one remove from the bigot
whose mental myopia limits him to a
single narrow facet.</div>

<p>Even such a thing as a May-day
picnic is polyhedral. The little schoolmistress,
who was the chief promoter
of the one at the Cross-Roads, would
have called it a parallelopiped, if she
had been there that morning, to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
seen the different expressions portrayed
on the faces of six people who were
interested in it.</p>

<p>The business side of the picnic appealed
to Bowser. As he bustled
around, dusting off cases of tinned
goods that he had long doubted his
ability to dispose of, and climbed to
the top shelves for last summer's shop-worn
cans of sardines and salmon, as he
sliced cheese, and counted out the little
leathery lemons that time had shrivelled,
his smile was as bland as the May
morning itself. One could plainly see
that he regarded this picnic as a special
dispensation of Providence, to help him
work off his old stock.</p>

<p>There were no loungers in the store.
Field and garden claimed even the
idlest, and only the old miller, who had
long ago earned his holiday, sat in the
sun on the porch outside, with his chair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
tipped back against the wall. At intervals
a warm breath from the apple orchard,
in bloom across the road, touched
his white hair in passing, and stirred his
memory until he sat oblivious of his surroundings.
He was wholly unmindful
of the gala stir about him, save when
Polly recalled his wandering thoughts.
She, keenly alive to every sensation of
the present, stood beside him with her
hand on his shoulder, while she waited
for her picnic basket to be filled.</p>

<p>"Isn't it an ideal May-day, grandfather?"
she exclaimed. "It gives
me a real Englishy feeling of skylarks
and cuckoos and cowslips, of primroses
and village greens. I think it is dear
of the little school-ma'am to resurrect
the old May-pole dance, and give the
children some idea of 'Merrie old
England' other than the dates and
dust of its ancient history." Unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
beating time with light fingertips
on the old man's shoulder, she
began to hum half under her breath:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'And then my heart with rapture thrills,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And dances with the daffodills-o-dills&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And dances with the daffodils!'"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Suddenly she broke off with a girlish
giggle of enjoyment. "Listen,
grandfather. There's little Cora Bowser
up-stairs, rehearsing her speech
while she dresses. Isn't it delicious to
be behind the scenes!"</div>

<p>Through an open bedroom window,
a high-pitched, affected little voice
came shrilly down to them: "'If you're
<i>wa</i>-king, call me <i>early!</i> Call me <i>early</i>,
mother dear!'"</p>

<p>"Now, Cora," interrupted the maternal
critic, "you went and forgot
to make your bow; and how many
times have I told you about turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
your toes out? You'll have to begin
all over again." Then followed several
beginnings, each brought to a stop
by other impatient criticisms. There
were so many pauses in the rehearsal
and reminders to pay attention to
manners, commas, and refractory ribbons,
that when Cora was finally
allowed to proceed, it was in a tearful
voice punctuated with sobs, that she
declared, "'To-morrow will be the
ha-happiest day of all the g-glad new
year.'"</p>

<p>"'Uneasy lies the head that wears
the crown,'" quoted the old miller
with a smile, as Mrs. Bowser's parting
injunction reached their ears.</p>

<p>"Now, Cora, for goodness' sake,
don't you forget for one minute this
whole enduring day, that them daisies
on your crown came off your teacher's
best hat, and have to be put back on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
If you move around much to the picnic
you might lose some of 'em. Best
keep pretty quiet anyway, or your sash
will come unpinned, and the crimp
will all get out of your hair. Wish I'd
thought to iron them plaits before I
unbraided 'em. They'd have been
lots frizzier."</p>

<p>It was a very stiffly starched, precise
little Queen o' the May who came
down the steep back stairs into the
store. She stepped like a careful peacock,
fearing to ruffle a feather of her
unrivalled splendour. Her straight
flaxen hair, usually as limp as a string,
stood out in much crimped profusion
from under her gilt paper crown.
Polly could not decide whether the
pucker on the little forehead came
from anxiety concerning the borrowed
daisies which starred her crown,
or the fact that it was too tightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
skewered to the royal head by a relentless
hat-pin.</p>

<p>One of the picnic wagons was waiting
at the door, and as Bowser lifted
her in among her envious and admiring
schoolmates, Polly saw with sympathetic
insight which of its many
sides the picnic parallelopiped was
presenting to the child in that proud
moment. The feeling of supreme importance
that it bestowed is a joy not
permitted to all, and rarely does it
come to any mortal more than once
in a lifetime.</p>

<p>But for every Haman, no matter
how resplendent, sits an unmoved Mordecai
in the king's gate. So to this
little Sheba of the Cross-Roads there
was one who bowed not down. Perkins's
oldest, on the front seat beside
the driver, had no eyes for her. He
scarcely looked in her direction. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
glances were all centred on the baskets
which Bowser was packing in
around his feet. He smelled pickles
and pies and ham sandwiches. He
knew of sundry tarts and dressed eggs
in his own basket, and wild rumours
had reached his ears that Miss Polly
intended to stand treat to the extent
of Bowser's entire stock of bananas and
candy. Aside from hopes of a surreptitious
swim in the creek and a wild
day in the woods, his ideas of a picnic
were purely prandial.</p>

<p>Across the road, Miss Anastasia Dill,
peeping through the blinds, watched the
wagon rattle off with its merry load.
Long after the laughing voices had
passed beyond her hearing, she still stood
there, one slender hand holding back the
curtain, and the other shading her faded
blue eyes, as she gazed absently after
them. It was the sunshine of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
May-day she was looking into.
Presently with a little start she realised
that she was not out in the cool green
woods with a May-basket in her hands,
brimming over with anemones. She
was all alone in her stuffy little parlour,
with its hair-cloth furniture and depressing
crayon portraits. And the
canary was chirping loudly for water,
and the breakfast cups were still unwashed.
But for once, heedless of her
duties, even unmindful of the fact that
she had left the shutters open, and the
hot sun was streaming across her cherished
store carpet, she drew a chair up
to the marble-topped centre table, and
deliberately sat down. There was a
pile of old-fashioned daguerreotypes in
front of her. She opened them one
by one, and then took up another that
lay by itself on a blue beaded mat.
So the face it dimly pictured held a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
sacred place, apart, in her memory.
When her eyes had grown misty with
long gazing, she lifted a book from its
place beside the family Bible. It was
bound in red leather, and it had a
quaint wreath of embossed roses around
the gilt letters of its title, "The Album
of the Heart." It was an autograph
album, and as she slowly turned the
pages she remembered that every hand
that had traced a sentiment or a signature
therein had once upon a time
gathered anemones with her in some
one of those other May-days.</p>

<p>Then she turned through the pages
again. Of all that circle of early
friends not one was left to give her a
hand-clasp. She had friends in plenty,
but the old ones&mdash;the early ones&mdash;the
roots of whose growth had twined
with hers in the intimacy known only
to childhood, were all gone. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
May-day picnic brought only a throb
of pain to gentle Miss Anastasia, for
to her it was but the lonely echo of
a "voice that was still."</p>

<p>Bud Hines watched the wagon drive
away with far different emotions.
He had happened to come into the
store for a new hoe, as the gay party
started. "It's all foolishness," he
grumbled to the miller, "to lose a
whole day's schooling while they go
gallivanting around the country for
nothing. They'll ride ten miles to
find a place to eat their dinner in, and
pass by twenty on the way nicer than
the one they finally pick out. They'd
better be doing sums in school, or
grubbing weeds out of the garden, instead
of playing 'frog in the meadow'
around a fool British May-pole."</p>

<p>He looked around inquiringly as if
he expected his practical listener to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
agree with him. But all the sympathy
he got from the old miller was one of
the innumerable proverbs he seemed
to keep continually on tap. "'All
work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy,' Bud. Life is apt to be little but
sums and grubbing for the youngsters
by and by, so let them make the most
of their May-days now."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The sequels of picnics are also polyhedral.
Miss Anastasia, lingering at
her front gate in the early twilight,
that she might enjoy to the last moment
the orchard odours that filled
all the balcony outdoors, heard the
rattle of returning wheels. She had
had a pleasant day, despite the tearful
retrospection of the morning, for she
had attended the great social function
of the neighbourhood, the monthly
missionary tea. It had brought immeasurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
cheer, and now she was
returning with a comfortable conviction
that she was to be envied far above
any of her neighbours. The consciousness
of having on her best gown, of
being the mistress of the trim little
home to which she was going, of freedom
from a hundred harassing cares
that she had heard discussed that afternoon,
all combined to make her supremely
contented with her lot.</p>

<p>"Poor children," she sighed, as the
tired, dirty little picnickers were lifted
from the wagon across the road.
"They look as if the game hadn't been
worth the candle. I'm glad that I've
outgrown such things."</p>

<p>Perkins's oldest, having soaked long
in the cold creek, and sampled every
dinner-basket with reckless abandon
till he could sample no more, sat
doubled up in the straw of the wagon-bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
He was white about the mouth,
and had he been called upon to debate
the time-worn question, "Resolved,
that there is more pleasure in pursuit
than in possession," the tarts and sandwiches
of that day's picnic would have
furnished several dozen indisputable
arguments for the affirmative.</p>

<p>The dishevelled little queen sat beside
him, tired out by her day's wild
frolic, with starch and frizzes all gone.</p>

<p>As she was lifted over the wheel, and
put down on the doorstep, a limp little
bunch of woe, Miss Anastasia heard
her bewailing her fate. She had lost
the stars from her crown, the borrowed
daisies that must be reckoned for on
the morrow. The amused listener
smiled to herself under cover of the
twilight, as she heard Bowser's awkward
attempts at consolation, for all
the comfort that he could muster was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
an old saw learned from the miller:
"Never mind, Cora, pa's mighty sorry
for his little girl. But you know:</p>

<div class='poem'>

<h2>Chapter VIII</h2>


<div class='cap'>THERE is something in the air
of June that stirs even insentient
things with a longing to
blossom. Staid old universities blaze
out with the gala colours of commencement
week, when the month of roses
is ushered in, and on every college
campus the social life of the student
year comes to flower in the crowning
exercises of class-day.</div>

<p>One wonders sometimes if the roots,
burrowing underground in order to
fill the bush overhead with myriads
of roses, have any share in the thrill of
success at having produced such a
wealth of sweetness and beauty. But
there need be no surmise about college
florescence. Faculties may beam with
complacency on their yearly cluster of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
full-blown graduates, the very walls
of the gray old universities may thrill
as they echo the applause of admiring
audiences, but the greatest pride is not
felt within the college town itself
where the student life centres. It is
back in the roots that have made college
life possible. Back in some parental
existence that daily sinks itself
farther into the commonplace in order
that some son or daughter may blossom
into the culture of arts and belles-lettres.
The Jacqueminot that flaunts
its glory over the garden wall may not
sweeten life for the fibres that lift it,
but the valedictorian who flaunts his
diploma and degree in the classic halls
of some sea-board college may be
glorifying the air of some little backwoods
village a thousand miles inland.
Even the Cross-Roads are bound with
a network of such far-reaching roots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
to the commencements of Harvard and
Yale.</p>

<p>It was Cy Akers's boy who came
home this June, a little lifted up, perhaps,
by the honours he had won;
thoroughly impressed with the magnitude
of his own knowledge and the
meagreness of other peoples', but honestly
glad at first to get back to the
old home and neighbours.</p>

<p>The family pride in him was colossal.
Old Cy encouraged his visits to
the Cross-Roads store, inventing excuses
for going which he considered the
acme of subtle diplomacy. But his
motives were as transparent as a child's.
Illiterate himself, he wanted his neighbours
to see what college had done for
his boy in the way of raising him head
and shoulders above them all. And
the boy was good-naturedly compliant.
He was as willing to show off mentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
as he had been to lend a hand in
the wheat harvest, and demonstrate
what football training had done for
him in the way of developing muscle.</p>

<p>Like Perkins's oldest, his education
had begun with the primer of the
Cross-Roads. He could remember the
time when he, too, had ignorantly
believed this to be the only store in
the universe, and wondered if there
were enough people living to consume
all its contents. Now he smiled to
himself when he looked around the
stuffy little room and saw the same old
butter firkins crowding the&mdash;apparently&mdash;same
old calico and crockery,
and looked up at the half-dozen hams
still swinging sociably from the low
rafters.</p>

<p>Time had been, too, when he thought
the men who gossiped around its rusty
stove on Saturday afternoons knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
everything. Like Perkins's oldest, he
had unquestioningly formulated the
creed of his boyhood from their conversations,
and he smiled again when
he recalled how he had been warped
in those early days by their prejudices
and short-sighted opinions.</p>

<p>The smile extended outwardly when
he walked into their midst to find
them repeating the same old saws about
the weather, and the way the country
was going to the dogs. Yet in his
salad days these time-honoured prognostications
had seemed to him the
wisdom of seers and sages.</p>

<p>Probably it was the thought that he
had travelled far beyond the narrow
confines of the Cross-Roads that gave
his conversation a patronising tone.
But the Cross-Roads refused to be
patronised. He learned that on the
day of his arrival. It was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
lesson of a valuable post-graduate course.
That a man away from home may
be Mister Robert Harrison Hamilton
Akers, with all the A. B.'s and LL. D.'s
after his name that an educational institution
can bestow; but as soon as he sets
foot again on his native heath, where
he has gone through the vicissitudes of
boyhood, he is shorn of titles and degrees
as completely as Samson was
shorn of his locks, and his strength
straightway falls from him. He is
nobody but Bobby Akers, and everybody
remembers when he robbed birds'
nests, and stole grapes, and played
hooky, and was a little freckle-faced,
snub-nosed neighbourhood terror. A
man cannot maintain his importance
long in the face of such reminiscences.
No amount of university culture is
going to lay the ghost of youthful indiscretions,
and he might as well put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
his patronising proclivities in his
pocket. They will not be tolerated
by those who have patted him on the
head when he wore roundabouts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was Saturday afternoon, but it was
also the and of the wheat-harvest, and
the men were afield who usually gathered
on the Cross-Roads porch to
round up the week over their pipes
and plugs of chewing tobacco. Only
three chairs were tilted back against
the wall, and on these, with their heels
caught over the front rungs, sat Bowser,
the old miller, and Robert Akers.</p>

<p>The whirr of reaping machines came
faintly up from the fields and near by,
where several acres of waving yellow
grain still stood uncut, a bob-white
whistled cheerily. No one was talking.
"Knee-deep in June" would have
voiced the thoughts of the trio, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they were "Jes' a sort o' lazein' there,"
with their hats pulled over their eyes,
enjoying to the utmost the perfect
afternoon. Every breeze was redolent
with red clover and wild honeysuckle,
and vibrant with soothing country
sounds.</p>

<p>"Who is that coming up the road?"
asked the miller, as a team and wagon
appeared over the brow of the hill.</p>

<p>"They wabble along like Duncan
Smith's horses," answered the storekeeper,
squinting his eyes for a better
view. "Yes, that's who it is. That's
Dunk on the top of the load. Moving
again, bless Pete!"</p>

<p>As the wagon creaked slowly nearer,
a feather bed came into view, surmounting
a motley collection of household
goods, and perched upon it, high
above the jangle of her jolting tins and
crockery, sat Mrs. Duncan Smith. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
clock and a looking-glass lay in her
lap, and, like a wise virgin, in her
hands she carefully bore the family
lamp. From frequent and anxious
turnings of her black sunbonnet, it was
evident that she was keeping her
weather eye upon the chicken-coop,
which was bound to the tail-board of
the wagon by an ancient clothes-line.</p>

<p>A flop-eared dog trotted along under
the wagon. Squeezed in between a
bureau and the feather bed, two shock-headed
children sat on a flour barrel,
clutching each other at every lurch of
the crowded van to keep from losing
their balance.</p>

<p>"Howdy, Dunk!" called the storekeeper,
as the dusty pilgrims halted in
front of the porch. "Where are you
bound now?"</p>

<p>"Over to the old Neal place," answered
the man, handing the reins to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
his wife, and climbing stiffly down
over the wheel. Going around to the
back of the wagon, he unstrapped a
kerosene can which swung from the
pole underneath.</p>

<p>"Gimme a gallon of coal-ile, Jim,"
he said. "I don't want to be left in
the dark the first night, anyway. It
takes awhile to git your bearings in a
strange place, and it's mighty confusing
to butt agin a half-open door where
you've always been used to a plain
wall, and it hurts like fire to bark your
shins on a rocking-chair when you're
steering straight for bed, and hain't no
idee it's in the road. This time it'll
be a little more so than usual," he
added, handing over the can. "The
house backs up agin a graveyard, you
know. Sort o' spooky till you git
used to it."</p>

<p>"What on earth did you move there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
for?" asked Bowser. "They say the
place is ha'nted."</p>

<p>"To my mind the dead make better
neighbours than the living," came the
tart reply from the depths of the black
sunbonnet. "At any rate, they mind
their own business."</p>

<p>"Oh, come now, Mrs. Smith," began
Bowser, good-naturedly. "Maybe
you've been unfortunate in your choice
of neighbours."</p>

<p>"I've had a dozen different kinds,"
came the emphatic answer. "This'll
make the twelfth move in eight years,
so you can't say that I'm speaking from
hearsay."</p>

<p>"Twelve moves in eight years!" exclaimed
Bowser, as the wagon went
lurching and creaking on through the
dust. "There's gipsy blood in that
Dunk Smith, sure as you live. Seems
like that family can't be satisfied anywhere;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
always thinking they can better
themselves by changing, and always
getting out of the frying-pan into the
fire. There wa'n't no well in the place
where they settled when they was first
married, and they had to carry water
from a spring. The muscle put into
packing that water up-hill those six
months would have dug a cistern, but
they were too short-sighted to see that.
They jest played Jack and Jill as long
as they could stand it, and then moved
to a place where there was a cistern
already dug. But there wa'n't any fruit
on that place. If they'd have set out
trees right away they'd have been eating
from orchards of their own planting
by this time. But they thought it
was easier to move to where one was
already set out.</p>

<p>"Then when they got to a place
where they had both fruit and water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
it was low, and needed draining. The
water settled around the house, and
they all had typhoid that summer. Oh,
they've spent enough energy packing
up and moving on and settling down
again in new places to have fixed the
first one up to a queen's taste. They
seem to be running a perpetual Home-seeker's
Excursion. Well, such a life
might suit some people, but it would
never do for me."</p>

<p>"But such a life has some things in
its favour," put in Rob Akers, always
ready to debate any question that offered,
for the mere pleasure of arguing. "It
keeps a man from getting into a rut,
and develops his ability to adapt himself
to any circumstance. A man who
hangs his hat on the same peg for fifty
or sixty years gets to be so dependent on
that peg that he would be uncomfortable
if it were suddenly denied him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Now Dunk Smith can never become
such a slave to habit. Then, too,
moving tends to leave a man more unhampered.
He gradually gets rid of
everything in his possessions but the
essentials. He hasn't a garret full of
old claptraps, as most people have
who never move from under their ancestral
roof-trees. You saw for yourself,
one wagon holds all his household
goods and gods.</p>

<p>"It is the same way with a man
mentally. If he stays in the spot where
his forefathers lived, in the same social
conditions, he is apt to let his upper
story accumulate a lot of worn-out
theories that he has no earthly use for;
all their old dusty dogmas and cob-webbed
beliefs. He will hang on to
them as on to the old furniture, because
he happened to inherit them. If
he would move once in awhile, keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
up with the times, you know, he'd get
rid of a lot of rubbish. It is especially
true in regard to his religion. All
those old superstitions, for instance,
about Jonah and the whale, and Noah's
ark and the like.</p>

<p>"He hangs on to them, not because
he cares for them himself, but because
they were his father's beliefs, and he
doesn't like to throw out anything the
old man had a sentiment for. Now,
as I say, if he'd move once in awhile&mdash;do
some scientific thinking and investigating
on his own account&mdash;he'd
throw out over half of what he holds
on to now. He'd cut the most of
Genesis out of his Bible, and let Job
slide as a myth. One of the finest bits
of literature, to be sure, that can be
found anywhere, but undoubtedly fiction.
The sooner a man moves on
untrammelled, I say, by those old heirlooms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of opinion, the better progress
he will make."</p>

<p>"Toward what?" asked the old
miller, laconically. "Dunk's moving
next door to the graveyard." There
was a twinkle in his eye, and the young
collegian, who flattered himself that
his speech was making a profound impression,
paused with the embarrassing
consciousness that he was affording
amusement instead.</p>

<p>"The last time I went East to visit
my grandson," said the old man, meditatively,
"his wife showed me a mahogany
table in her dining-room which
she said was making all her friends
break the tenth commandment. It
was a handsome piece of furniture,
worth a small fortune. It was polished
till you could see your face in it, and
I thought it was the newest thing out
in tables till she told me she'd rummaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
it out of her great-grandmother's
attic, and had it 'done over' as she
called it. It had been hidden away in
the dust and cobwebs for a lifetime
because it had been pronounced too
time-worn and battered and scratched
for longer use; yet there it stood, just as
beautiful and useful for this generation
to spread its feasts on as it was the day it
was made. Every whit as substantial,
and aside from any question of sentiment,
a thousand times more valuable
than the one that Dunk Smith drove
past with just now. His table is modern,
to be sure, but it's of cheap pine,
too rickety to serve even Dunk through
his one short lifetime of movings.</p>

<p>"I heard several lectures while I
was there, too. One was by a man
who has made a name for himself on
both sides of the water as a scientist
and a liberal thinker. He took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Genesis, all scratched and battered as it
is by critics, and showed us how it had
been misunderstood and misconstrued.
And by the time he'd polished up the
meaning here and there, so that we
could see the original grain of the
wood, what it was first intended to
be, it seemed like a new book, and
fitted in with all the modern scientific
ideas as if it had been made only yesterday.</p>

<p>"There it stood, like the mahogany
table that had been restored after people
thought they had stowed it away
in the attic to stay. Just as firm on
its legs, and as substantial for this generation
to put its faith on, as it was in
the days of the Judges.</p>

<p>"Take an old man's word for it,
Robert, who has lived a long time and
seen many a restless Dunk Smith fling
out his father's old heirlooms, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
fever to move on to something new.
Solid mahogany, with all its dust and
scratches, is better than the modern
flimsy stuff, either in faith or furniture,
that he is apt to pick up in its stead."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter IX</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE booming of distant cannon
had been sounding at intervals
since midnight, ushering in
the Fourth, but Bowser, although disturbed
in his slumbers by each reverberation,
did not rouse himself to any
personal demonstration until dawn.
Then his patriotism manifested itself
in a noisy tattoo with a hammer, as he
made the front of his store gay with
bunting, and nailed the word <i>Welcome</i>
over the door, in gigantic letters of red,
white, and blue.</div>

<p>When he was done, each window
wore a bristling eyebrow of stiff little
flags, that gave the store an air of
mild surprise. The effect was wholly
unintentional on Bowser's part, and,
unconscious of the likeness to human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
eyes he had given his windows, he
gazed at his work with deep satisfaction.</p>

<p>But the expression was an appropriate
one, considering all the astonishing
sights the old store was to look
upon that day. In the woodland across
the railroad track, just beyond Miss
Anastasia Dill's little cottage, preparations
were already begun for a grand
barbecue. Even before Bowser had
finished tacking up his flags, the digging
of the trench had begun across the way,
and the erection of a platform for the
speakers. In one corner of the woodland
a primitive merry-go-round had
already been set in place, and the first
passenger train from the city deposited
an enterprising hoky-poky man, a peanut
and pop-corn vender, and a lank
black-bearded man with an outfit for
taking tin-types.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>By ten o'clock the wood-lot fence
was a hitching-place for all varieties of
vehicles, from narrow sulkies to cavernous
old carryalls. A haze of thick
yellow dust, extending along the pike
as far as one could see, was a constant
accompaniment of fresh arrivals. Each
newcomer emerged from it, his Sunday
hat and coat powdered as thickly as the
wayside weeds. Smart side-bar buggies
dashed up, their shining new tops
completely covered with it. There
was a great shaking of skirts as the
girls alighted, and a great flapping of
highly perfumed handkerchiefs, as the
young country beaux made themselves
presentable, before joining the other
picnickers.</p>

<p>Slow-going farm wagons rattled
along, the occupants of their jolting
chairs often representing several generations,
for the drawing power of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Fourth of July barbecue reaches from
the cradle to the grave.</p>

<p>The unusual sight of such a crowd,
scattered through the grove in gala
attire, was enough of itself to produce
a holiday thrill, and added to this was
the smell of gunpowder from occasional
outbursts of firecrackers, the
chant of the hoky-poky man, and the
hysterical laughter of the couples patronising
the merry-go-round, as they
clung giddily to the necks of the
wooden ostriches and camels in the first
delights of its dizzy whirl.</p>

<p>"Good as a circus, isn't it?" exclaimed
Robert Akers, pausing beside
the bench where the old miller and
the minister sat watching the gay
scene. "I'm having my fun walking
around and taking notes. It is amusing
to see how differently the affair
impresses people, and what seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
make each fellow happiest. Little
Tommy Bowser, for instance, is in the
seventh heaven following the hoky-poky
man. He gets all that people
leave in their dishes for helping to
drum up a crowd of patrons. Perkins's
boy sticks by the merry-go-round. He
has spent every cent of his own money,
and had so many treats that he's spun
around till he's so dizzy he's cross-eyed.
One old fellow I saw back there is
simply sitting on the fence grinning at
everything that goes by. He's getting
his enjoyment in job lots."</p>

<p>"Sit down," said the minister, sociably
moving along the bench to
make room beside him for the young
man. "Mr. Holmes and I are finding
our amusement in the same way, only
we are not going around in search of
it. We are catching at it as it drifts
by."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"What has happened to Mrs. Teddy
Mahone?" exclaimed Rob, as a red-faced
woman with an important self-conscious
air hurried by. "She seems
ubiquitous this morning, and as proud
as a peacock over something. One
would think she were the mistress of
ceremonies from her manner."</p>

<p>"Or hostess, rather," said the miller.
"She met me down by the fence on
my arrival, and held out her hand as
graciously as if she were a duchess in
her own drawing-room, and I an invited
guest.</p>

<p>"'Gude marnin' to yez, Mr. Holmes,'
she said. 'I hope ye'll be afther enjyin'
yerself the day. If anything intherferes
wid yer comfort ye've but to
shpake to Mahone about it. He's been
appinted <i>constable</i> for the occasion, ye
understhand. If I do say it as oughtn't,
he can carry the title wid the best av<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
'im; him six fut two in his stockin's,
an' the shtar shinin' on his wes'cut loike
he'd been barn to the job.'</p>

<p>"Then she turned to greet some
strangers from Morristown, and I heard
her introducing herself as Mrs. <i>Constable</i>
Mahone, and repeating the same
instructions she had given me, to report
to her husband, in case everything was
not to their liking."</p>

<p>Both listeners laughed at the miller's
imitation of her brogue, and the minister
quoted, with an amused smile:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'For never title yet so mean could prove,<br />
But there was eke a mind, which did that title love.'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>It is a pity we cannot dress more of
them in 'a little brief authority.' It
seems to be a means of grace to a certain
class of Hibernians. It has Americanised
the Mahones, for instance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
You'll find no patriots on the ground
to-day more enthusiastic than Mr. and
Mrs. Constable Mahone. Fourth of
July will be an honoured feast-day
henceforth in their calendar. It is
often surprising how quickly a policeman's
buttons and billy will make a
good citizen out of the wildest bog-trotter
that ever brandished a shillalah."</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Later, in subsequent wanderings
around the grounds, the young collegian
spied the little schoolmistress helping
to keep guard over the cake-table.
He immediately crossed over and joined
her. She was looking unusually pretty,
and there was an amused gleam in her
eyes as she watched the crowds, which
made him feel that she was viewing the
scene from his standpoint; that he
had found a kindred spirit.</p>

<p>"What incentive to patriotism do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
you see in all this, Miss Helen?" he
asked, when he had induced her to
turn over her guardianship of the cake-table
to some one else, and join him in
his tour among the boisterous picnickers.</p>

<p>"None at all&mdash;yet," she answered.
"I suppose that will come by and by
with the songs and speeches. But
all this foolishness seems a legitimate
part of the celebration to me. You
remember Lowell says, 'If I put on
the cap and bells, and made myself
one of the court fools of King Demos,
it was less to make his Majesty laugh
than to win a passage to his royal ears
for certain serious things which I had
deeply at heart.' It takes a barbecue
and its attendant attractions to draw a
crowd like this. See what a hotch-potch
it is of all nationalities. Now
that Schneidmacher family never would
have driven ten miles in this heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and dust simply to hear the band
play 'Hail, Columbia,' and Judge
Jackson make one of his spread-eagle
speeches on the Duty of the American
Citizen. Neither would the O'Gradys
or any of the others who represent the
foreign element in the neighbourhood.
Even Young America himself, the type
we see here, is more willing to come
and bring his best girl on account of
the diversions offered."</p>

<p>"Well, that may be so," was the
reluctant assent, "but if this is a sample
of the Fourth of July observances all
over the country I can't help feeling
sorry for Uncle Sam. Patriotism has
sadly degenerated from the pace that
Patrick Henry set for it."</p>

<p>"The old miller says not," answered
the little schoolmistress. "I made that
same complaint last Washington's Birthday,
when I was trying to work my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
school up to proper enthusiasm for the
occasion. He recalled the drouth of
the summer before when nearly every
well and creek and pond in the township
went dry. Cattle died of thirst,
gardens dried up like brick-kilns, and
people around here were almost justified
in thinking that the universe would
soon be entirely devoid of water. The
skies were like brass, and there was no
indication of rain for weeks. But one
day there was a terrific earthquake
shock. It started all the old springs,
and opened new ones all over this part
of the country, and the water gushed
out of the earth where it had been
pent up all the time, only waiting for
some such touch to call it forth. 'And
you're afraid that patriotism is going
dry in this generation,' he said to me.
'But it only takes some shock like the
sinking of the <i>Maine</i>, or some sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
menace to the public safety, to start a
spring that will gush from Plymouth
Rock to the Golden Gate. There is a
deep underground vein in the American
heart that no drouth can ever dry.
Maybe it does not come to the surface
often, but it can always be depended
on in time of need.'"</p>

<p>The speakers for the day began to
arrive, and Rob, seeing the crowds
gravitating toward the grand stand,
took the little schoolmistress to the
bench where the miller had stationed
himself.</p>

<p>"Watch that old Scotchman just in
front of us," whispered the girl, "Mr.
Sandy McPherson. Last Thanksgiving
there was a union service in the schoolhouse.
After the sermon 'America' was
sung, and that old heathen stood up
and roared out through it all, at the
top of his voice, every word of 'God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Save the Queen!' Wasn't that flaunting
the thistle in our faces with a vengeance?
I am sure that he will repeat
the performance to-day. Think of the
dogged persistence that refuses to succumb
to the fact that we have thrown
off the British yoke! The very day we
are celebrating that event, he'll dare to
mix up our national hymn with 'God
Save the King.'"</p>

<p>It was as she had predicted. As the
band started with a great clash of
brazen instruments, and the whole
company rose to the notes of "America,"
Sandy McPherson's big voice, with
its broad Scotch burr, rolled out like
a bass drum:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Thy choicest gifts in store,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On <i>him</i> be pleased to pour.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Long may <i>he</i> reign.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>It drowned out every voice around
him. "He ought to be choked," exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Rob, in righteous indignation,
as they resumed their seats. "To-day
of all days! The old Tory has been
living in this country for forty-five
years, and a good living he's gotten out
of it, too, for himself and family. Nobody
cares what he sings on his own
premises, but he might have the
decency to keep his mouth shut on
occasions of this kind, if he can't join
with us."</p>

<p>There was a gleam of laughter in
the little schoolmistress's eyes as she
replied: "If the truth were known I
have no doubt but that this Fourth of
July celebration is very like the pie
in Mother Goose's song of sixpence,
when her four and twenty blackbirds
were baked in a pie. If this pie could
be opened, and the birds begin to sing
according to their sentiments, there
would be a wonderful diversity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
tunes. One would be twittering the
'Marseillaise,' and another 'Die Wacht
am Rhein,' and another echoing old
Sandy's tune. America was in too big
a hurry to serve her national pie, I am
afraid. Consequently she put it in
half prepared, and turned it out half
baked. The blackbirds should have
had their voices tuned to the same key
before they were allowed to become
vital ingredients of such an important
dish."</p>

<p>"In other words," laughed Rob,
"you'd reconstruct the enfranchisement
laws. Make the term of probationary
citizenship so long that the
blackbird would have time to change
his vocal chords, or even the leopard
his anarchistic spots, before he would
be considered fit to be incorporated in
the national dish. By the way, Miss
Helen, have you heard Mrs. Mahone's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
allegory of the United Pudding bag?
You and she ought to collaborate.
Get the storekeeper to repeat it to you
sometime."</p>

<p>"You needn't laugh," responded the
little schoolmistress, a trifle tartly.
"You know yourself that scores of
emigrants are given the ballot before
they can distinguish 'Yankee Doodle'
from 'Dixie,' and that is only typical
of their ignorance in all matters regarding
governmental affairs. Too many
people's idea of good citizenship is like
the man's 'who kept his private pan
just where 'twould catch most public
drippings.' There is another mistaken
idea loose in the land," she continued,
after a moment. "That is, that a
great hero must be a man who has a
reputation as a great soldier. I wish
I had the rewriting of all the school
histories. They are better now than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
when I studied them, but there is still
vast room for improvement. I had to
learn page after page of wars. Really,
war and history were synonyms then
as it was taught in the schools. Every
chapter was gory, and we were required
to memorise the numbers killed,
wounded, and captured in every battle,
from the French and Indian massacres,
down to the last cannon-shot of the
sixties. That is all right for government
records and reference libraries,
but when we give a text-book to the
rising generation, the accounts of battles
and the glorifying thereof would
be better relegated to the foot-notes.
It is loyal statesmanship that ought
to be exalted in our school histories.
We ought to make our heroes out of
the legislators who cannot be bribed
and public men who cannot be bought,
and the honest private citizen who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
<i>lives</i> for his country instead of dying
for it."</p>

<p>The old miller beside her applauded
softly, leaning over to say, as the overture
by the band came to a close with
a grand clash, "If ever the blackbirds
are tuned to one key, Miss Helen,
America will know whom to thank.
Not the legislators, but the patriotic
little schoolma'ams all over their land
who are serving their country in a
way her greatest generals cannot do."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All day the Cross-Roads store raised
its bristling eyebrows of little flags, till
the celebration came to a close. Savoury
whiffs of the barbecued meats
floated across to it, vigorous hand-clapping
and hearty cheers rang out to it
between the impassioned words of excited
orators. Later there were the
fireworks, and more rag-time music by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the band, and renewed callings of the
hoky-poky man. But before the moon
came up there was a great backing of
teams and scraping of turning wheels,
and a gathering together of picnic-baskets
and stray children.</p>

<p>"Well, it's over for another year,"
said Bowser, welcoming the old miller,
who had crossed the road and taken a
chair on the porch to wait until the
crowds were out of the way.</p>

<p>"Those were fine speeches we had
this afternoon, but seemed to me as if
they were plumb wasted on the majority
of that crowd. They applauded
them while they were going off, same
as they did the rockets, but they forget
in the next breath." As Bowser spoke,
a rocket whizzed up through the tree
tops, and the old miller, looking up to
watch the shining trail fade out, saw
that the sky was full of stars.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the good of those speeches,
Bowser," he said. "'<i>To leave a wake,
men's hearts and faces skyward turning.</i>'
I hadn't noticed that the stars were out
till that rocket made me look up. The
speeches may be forgotten, but they
will leave a memory in their wake that
give men an uplook anyhow."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter X</h2>


<div class='cap'>"GUESS who's come to board at
the Widder Powers's for the
month of August?" It was
Bowser who asked the question, and
who immediately answered it himself,
as every man on the porch looked up
expectantly.</div>

<p>"Nobody more nor less than a <i>multimillionaire!</i>
The big boot and shoe
man, William A. Maxwell. Mrs.
Powers bought a bill of goods this
morning as long as your arm. It's a
windfall for <i>her</i>. He offered to pay
regular summer-resort-hotel prices, because
she's living on the old farm where
he was born and raised, and he fancied
getting back to it for a spell."</p>

<p>"Family coming with him?" queried
Cy Akers, after a moment's meditation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
over the surprising fact that a millionaire
with the world before him should
elect such a place as the Cross-Roads
in which to spend his vacation.</p>

<p>"No, you can bet your bottom
dollar they're not. And they're all
abroad this summer or <i>he'd</i> never got
here. They'd had him dragged off to
some fashionable watering-place with
them. But when the cat's away the
mice'll play, you know. Mrs. Powers
says it is his first visit here since his
mother's funeral twenty years ago, and
he seems as tickled as a boy to get
back.</p>

<p>"Yesterday evening he followed the
man all around the place while she was
getting supper. She left him setting
up in the parlour, but when she went
in to ask him out to the table, he was
nowhere to be seen. Pretty soon he
came walking around the corner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
house with a pail of milk in each hand,
sloshing it all over his store clothes.
He'd done the milking himself, and
seemed mightily set up over it."</p>

<p>"Lawzee! Billy Maxwell! Don't
I remember him?" exclaimed Bud
Hines. "Seems like 'twas only yesterday
we used to sit on the same bench
at school doin' our sums out of the
same old book. The year old man
Prosser taught, we got into so much
devilment that it got to be a regular
thing for him to say, regular as clock-work,
almost, 'I'll whip Bud Hines
and Billy Maxwell after the first arithmetic
class this morning.' I don't
s'pose he ever thinks of those old times
since he's got to be one of the Four
Hundred. Somehow I can hardly
sense it, his bein' so rich. He never
seemed any smarter than the rest of us.
That's the way of the world, though,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
seesaw, one up and the other down.
Of course it's my luck to be the one
that's down. Luck always was against
me."</p>

<p>"There he is now," exclaimed the
storekeeper, and every head turned to
see the stranger stepping briskly along
the platform in front of the depot, on
his way to the telegraph office.</p>

<p>He had the alertness of glance and
motion that comes from daily contact
with city corners. If there was a slight
stoop in his broad shoulders, and if his
closely cut hair and beard were iron
gray, that seemed more the result of
bearing heavy responsibilities than the
token of advancing years. His immaculate
linen, polished low-cut shoes, and
light gray business suit would have
passed unnoticed in the metropolis, but
in this place, where coats and collars
were in evidence only on Sunday, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
gave him the appearance of being on
dress parade.</p>

<p>Perkins's oldest eyed him as he
would a zebra or a giraffe, or some
equally interesting curiosity escaped
from a Zoo. He had heard that his
pockets were lined with gold, and that
he had been known to pay as much as
five dollars for a single lunch. Five
dollars would board a man two weeks
at the Cross-Roads.</p>

<p>With his mouth agape, the boy
stood watching the stranger, who presently
came over to the group on the
porch with smiling face and cordial
outstretched hand. Despite his gray
hair there was something almost boyish
in the eagerness with which he
recognised old faces and claimed old
friendships. Bowser's store had been
built since his departure from the
neighbourhood, so few of the congenial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
spirits accustomed to gather there were
familiar to him. But Bud Hines and
Cy Akers were old schoolfellows.
When he would have gone up to them
with old-time familiarity, he found
a certain restraint in their greeting
which checked his advances.</p>

<p>If he thought he was coming back
to them the same freckle-faced, unconventional
country lad they had known
as Billy Maxwell, he was mistaken.
He might feel that he was the same at
heart; but they looked on the outward
appearance. They saw the successful
man of the world who had
outstripped them in the race and passed
out of their lives long ago. They
could not conceive of such a change
as had metamorphosed the boy they
remembered into the man who stood
before them, without feeling that
a corresponding change must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
taken place in his attitude toward
them.</p>

<p>They were not conscious that this
feeling was expressed in their reception
of him. They laughed at his jokes,
and indulged in some reminiscences,
but he felt, in a dim subconscious way,
that there was a barrier between them,
and he could never get back to the old
familiar footing.</p>

<p>He turned away, vaguely disappointed.
Had he dared to dream that
he would find his lost youth just as he
had left it? The fields and hills were
unchanged. The very trees were the
same, except that they had added a
few more rings to their girth, and
threw a larger circling shade. But the
old chums he had counted on finding
had not followed the same law of
growth as the trees. The shade of their
sympathies had narrowed, not expanded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with the passing years, and left him
outside their contracted circle.</p>

<p>Perkins's oldest, awed by reports of
his fabulous wealth, could hardly find
his tongue when the distinguished visitor
laid a friendly hand on his embarrassed
tow head, and inquired about
the old swimming-hole, and the mill-dam
where he used to fish. But the
boy's interest grew stronger every minute
as he watched him turning over
the limited assortment of fishing tackle.
The men he knew had outlived such
frivolous sports. It was a sight to justify
one's gazing open-mouthed,&mdash;a
grown man deliberately preparing for
a month's idleness.</p>

<p>If the boy could have seen the
jointed rods, the reels, the flies, all the
expensive angler's outfit left behind in
the Maxwell mansion; if he could
have known of the tarpon this man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
had caught in Florida bays, and the
fishing he had enjoyed in northern
waters, he would have wondered still
more; wondered how a man could be
considered in his right mind who deliberately
renounced such privileges to
come and drop a common hook, on a
pole of his own cutting, into the shallow
pools of the Cross-Roads creek.</p>

<p>After his purchases no one saw him
at the store for several days, but the
boy, dodging across lots, encountered
him often,&mdash;a solitary figure wandering
by the mill stream, or crashing
through the woods with long eager
strides; lying on the orchard grass sometimes
with his hat pulled over his
eyes; leaning over the pasture bars in
the twilight, and following with wistful
glance the little foot-path stretching
white across the meadows. A
pathetic sight to eyes wise enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
see the pathos,&mdash;a world-weary, middle-aged
man in vain quest of his lost
boyhood.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Polly, looking across the
church from her place in the miller's
pew, recognised the stranger in their
midst, and straightway lost the thread
of the sermon in wondering at his
presence. She had gone to school
with his daughter, Maud Maxwell.
She had danced many a german with
his son Claude. They lived on the
same avenue, and passed each other
daily; but this was the first time she
had seen him away from the shadow
of the family presence, that seemed to
blot out his individuality.</p>

<p>She had thought of him only as
Maud's father, a simple, good-natured
nonentity in his own household. A
good business man, but one who could
talk nothing but leather, and whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
only part in the family affairs was to
furnish the funds for his wife and children
to shine socially.</p>

<p>"Oh, your father's opinion doesn't
count," she had heard Mrs. Maxwell
say on more than one occasion, and
the children had grown up, unconsciously
copying her patronising attitude
toward him. As Polly studied
his face now in the light of other surroundings,
she saw that it was a strong,
kindly one; that it was not weakness
which made him yield habitually, until
he had become a mere figurehead in
his own establishment. It was only
that his peace-loving nature hated
domestic scenes, and his generosity
amounted to complete self-effacement
when the happiness of his family was
concerned.</p>

<p>His eyes were fixed on the chancel
with a wistful reminiscent gaze, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Polly read something in the careworn
face that touched her sympathy.
"Grandfather," she said, at the close
of the service, "let's be neighbourly
and ask Mr. Maxwell home to dinner
with us. He looks lonesome."</p>

<p>She was glad afterward that she had
suggested it, when she recalled his
evident pleasure in the old man's company.
There were chairs out under
the great oak-trees in the yard, and the
two sat talking all afternoon of old
times, until the evening shadows began
to grow long across the grass. Then
Polly joined them again, and sat with
them till the tinkle of home-going cowbells
broke on the restful stillness of
the country Sabbath.</p>

<p>"All the orchestras in all the operas
in the world can't make music that
sounds as sweet to me as that does," said
Mr. Maxwell, raising his head from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the big armchair to listen. Then he
dropped it again with a sigh.</p>

<p>"It rests me so after the racket of
the city. If Julia would only consent,
I'd sell out and come back to-morrow.
But she's lost all interest in the old
place. I'm country to the core, but
she never was. She took to city ways
like a duck to water, just as soon as
she got away from the farm, and she
laughs at me for preferring katydids to
the whirr of electric cars."</p>

<p>A vision rose before the old miller
of a little country girl in a pink cotton
gown, who long ago used to wait,
bright-eyed and blushing, at the pasture
bars, for Billy to drive home the
cows. Many a time he had passed
them at their trysting-place. Then
he recalled the superficial, ambitious
woman he had met years afterward
when he visited his son. He shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
his head when he thought of her renouncing
her social position for the
simple pastoral life her husband longed
to find the way back to. Presently he
broke the silence of their several reveries
by turning to Polly.</p>

<p>"What's that piece you recited to
me the other night, little girl, about
old times? Say it for Mr. Maxwell."
And Polly, clasping her hands in her
lap, and looking away across the
August meadows, purple with the
royal pennons of the ironweed, began
the musical old poem:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Ko-ling, ko-lang, ko-linglelingle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Way down the darkening dingle</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The cows come slowly home.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">(And old-time friends and twilight plays</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And starry nights and sunny days</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Come trooping up the misty ways,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When the cows come home.)</span><br />
<br />
"'And over there on Merlin Hill<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hear the plaintive cry of the whippoorwill.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And the dewdrops lie on the tangled vines,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And over the poplars Venus shines,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And over the silent mill.</span><br />
<br />
"'Ko-ling, ko-lang, ko-linglelingle,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">With ting-aling and jingle</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The cows come slowly home.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For dear old times come back again,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When the cows come home.)'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Once as Polly went on, she saw the
tears spring to his eyes at the line "and
mother-songs of long-gone years," and
she knew that the</p>

<div class='poem'>
"same sweet sound of wordless psalm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The same sweet smell of buds and balm,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>that had been his delight in the past,
were his again as he listened. But,
much to her surprise, as she finished,
he rose abruptly, and began a hurried
leave-taking. She understood his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
manner, however, when his mood was
revealed to her a little later.</div>

<p>At her grandfather's suggestion she
walked down to the gate with him, to
point out a short cut across the fields
to Mrs. Powers's. Outside the gate he
paused, hat in hand.</p>

<p>"Miss Polly," he began, as if unconsciously
taking her into his confidence,
"old times never come back
again. Seems as if the bottom had
dropped out of everything. I've done
my best to resurrect them, but I can't
do it. I thought if I could once get
back to the old place I could rest as
I've not been able to rest for twenty
years&mdash;that I'd have a month of perfect
enjoyment. But something's the
matter.</p>

<p>"Many a time when I've been off
at some fashionable resort I've thought
I'd give a fortune to be able to drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
my hook in your grandfather's mill-stream,
and feel the old thrill that I
used to feel when I was a boy. I tried
it the day I came&mdash;caught a little
speckled trout, the kind that used to
make me tingle to my finger ends, but
somehow it didn't bring back the old
sensation. I just looked at it a minute
and put it back in the water, and
threw my pole away.</p>

<p>"Even the swimming-hole down by
the mill didn't measure up to the way
I had remembered it. I've fairly ached
for a dip into it sometimes, in the years
I've been gone. Seemed as if I could
just get into it once, I could wash myself
clear of all the cares and worries
of business that pester a man so. That
was a disappointment, too. The change
is in me, I guess, but nothing seems
the same."</p>

<p>Polly knew the reason. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
tried so long to mould his habits to fit
his wife's exacting tastes, that he had
succeeded better than he realised. He
could not analyse his feelings enough to
know that it was the absence of long
accustomed comforts that made him
vaguely dissatisfied with his surroundings;
his luxuriously appointed bathroom,
for instance; the perfect service
of his carefully trained footmen. Mrs.
Powers's noisy table, where with great
clatter she urged every one "to fall
to and help himself," jarred on him,
although he was unconscious of what
caused the irritation. As for the rank
tobacco Bowser furnished him when
he had exhausted his own special brand
of cigars with which he had stocked
his satchel, it was more than flesh and
blood could endure. That is, flesh
and blood that had acquired the pampered
taste of a millionaire whose wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'fastidous'">fastidious</ins>, and only allows first-class
aromas in the way of the weed.</p>

<p>But Polly knew another reason that
his vacation had been a failure. She
divined it as the little Yale pin, stuck
jauntily into the front of her white
dress, met the touch of her caressing
fingers. The girl in the pink cotton
gown was long dead, and the woman
who had grown up in her stead had no
part in the old scenes that he still
fondly clung to, with a sentiment she
ridiculed because she could not understand.
<i>There must always be two when
you turn back searching for your lost Eldorado,
and even the two cannot find it,
unless they go hand in hand.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next day Bowser had another piece
of news to impart. "Mr. Maxwell
went home this morning. He told
Mrs. Powers it was like taking a vacation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in a graveyard, and he'd had enough.
He'd have to get back to work again.
So he paid her for the full month, and
took the first train back to the city."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be switched!" was Bud
Hines's comment. "If I had as much
money as he's got, I'd never bother
my head about work. I'd sit down
and take it easy all the rest of my born
days."</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Bowser,
meditatively. "I reckon a man who's
worked the way Mr. Maxwell has,
gets such a big momentum on to himself
that he can't stop, no matter how
bad he wants a vacation."</p>

<p>"He's a fool for coming back here
for it," said Bud Hines, looking out
across the fields that stretched away on
every side in unbroken monotony.</p>

<p>But miles away, in his city office,
the busy millionaire was still haunted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
by an unsatisfied longing for those
same level meadows. Glimpses of the
old mill-stream and the willows still
rose before him in tantalising freshness,
and whenever he closed his tired eyes,
down twilight paths, where tinkling
cowbells called, there came again the
glimmer of a little pink gown, to wait
for him as it had waited through all
the years, beside the pasture bars.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XII</h2>


<div class='cap'>THE seat was an empty starch-box
on the Cross-Roads porch,
its occupant a barefoot boy
with a torn straw hat pulled far down
over his eyes. To the casual observer
one of the most ordinary of sights, but
to one possessed of sympathetic powers
of penetration into a boy's inner consciousness
there was a suggestion of the
tragic. Perkins's oldest had that afternoon
in school been told to write a
composition on September. It was to
be handed in next morning. It was the
hopelessness of accomplishing the fact
even in ons, not to mention the limited
time of a dozen short hours, that had
bound him, a little Prometheus, to the
starch-box, with the vulture of absolute
despair tearing at his vitals.</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Two other boys had been assigned
the same subject, and the three had
kicked the dust up wrathfully all the
way from the schoolhouse, echoing
an old cry that had gone up ages before
from the sons of Jacob, under the
lash of the Egyptian, "How can we
make bricks without straw?"</p>

<p>"Ain't nothin' to say 'bout September,"
declared Riley Hines, gloomily,
"and I'll be dogged if I say it. I'm
goin' to get my sister to write mine fer
me. She'll do it ef I tease long
enough, and give her something to
boot."</p>

<p>"I'll ask paw what to say," declared
Tommy Bowser. "He won't write it
for me, but he'll sort o' boost me along.
Then if it ain't what she wants, <i>I</i> won't
be to blame. I'll tell her paw said
'twas all right."</p>

<p>This shifting of responsibility to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
paternal shoulders restored the habitual
expression of cheerfulness to Tommy's
smudgy face, but there was no corresponding
smile on Sammy's. There
was no help to be had in the household
of Perkins.</p>

<p>That was why he was waiting on
the starch-box while Tommy was sent
on an errand. It was in the vain hope
that Tommy would return and apply
for his "boost" and share it with him
before darkness fell. He was a practical
child, not given to whimsical
reflections, but as he sat there in desperate
silence, he began wondering
what the different customers would
have to say if they were suddenly called
upon, as he had been that afternoon,
to write about September.</p>

<p>Mrs. Powers, for instance, in her
big crape bonnet, with its long wispy
veil trailing down her back. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
almost startled, when, as if in answer
to his thought, she uttered the word
that was at the bottom of his present
trouble, the subject assigned him for
composition.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Bowser, September is a
month that I'm never sorry to say good-bye
to. What with the onion pickle
and peach preserves and the house-cleaning
to tend to, I'm nearly broke
down when it's over. There's so many
odds and ends to see to on a farm this
time of year, first in doors and then
out. I tell Jane it's like piecing a
crazy quilt. You can't never count on
what a day's going to bring forth in September.
You may get a carpet up and
beat, and have your stove settin' out
waiting to be put up, and your furniture
in a heap in the yard, and the
hired man will have to go off and leave
it all while he takes the cider-mill to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
be mended. And you in a stew all
day long for fear it'll rain before he
gets things under shelter.</p>

<p>"Then it's a sad time to me, too,"
she exclaimed with a mournful shake
of the head in the black bonnet. "It
was in September I lost my first and
third husbands, two of the best that
ever had tombstones raised to their
memory, if I do say it as oughtn't.
One died on the sixteenth, and his
funeral was preached on the eighteenth,
and the other died fifteen years later
on the twenty-third, and we kept him
three days, on account of waiting till
his brother could get here from Missouri.
So you see that makes nearly
a week altogether of mournful anniversaries
for me every September."</p>

<p>Another breath and she had reached
the three tombstones, and talking
volubly on her favourite subject, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
completed her purchases and went out.
But her conversation had not lightened
the woes of the little Prometheus on
the starch-box. Despair still gnawed
on. House-cleaning worries and onion
pickle, and reminiscences of two out of
three departed husbands, might furnish
material for Mrs. Powers's composition,
should the fates compel her to write
one, but there was no straw of a suggestion
for Sammy Perkins, and again
he cried out inwardly as bitterly as the
oppressed of old had cried out against
Pharaoh.</p>

<p>A man in a long, sagging linen duster
was the next comer. He squeaked
back and forth in front of the counter
in new high-heeled boots, and talked
incessantly while he made his purchases,
with a clumsy attempt at facetiousness.</p>

<p>"Put in a cake of shaving-soap, too,
Jim," he called, passing his hand over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the black stubble on his chin. "County
court begins to-morrer. Reckon the
lawyers will shave everything in sight
when it comes to their bills, but I want
to be as slick as them. I'll be settin'
on the jury all week. Did you ever
think of it, Jim, that's a mighty interesting
way to earn your salt? Jest set
back and be entertained with the history
of all the old feuds and fusses in
the county, and collect your two bucks
a day without ever turning your hand
over. Good as a show, and dead easy.</p>

<p>"Only one thing, it sort o' spiles
your faith in human nature. The
court stenographer said last year that
in the shorthand he writes, the same
mark that stands for lawyer stands for
liar, too. He! he! he! isn't that a
good one? You can only tell which
one is meant by what comes before it,
and this fellow said he'd come to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
that one always fit in the sentence
as good as the other. Either word
was generally appropriate. You miss
a lot of fun, Jim, by not getting on
the jury. I always look forrard to fall
on that account."</p>

<p>No help for Perkins's oldest in <i>that</i>
conversation. He waited awhile longer.
Presently an old gentleman in a long-tailed,
quaintly cut black coat, stepped
up on the porch. He had a gold-headed
cane under his arm, and the
eyes behind the square-bowed spectacles
beamed kindly on the little
fellow. He stopped beside the starch-box
a moment with a friendly question
about school and the health of the
Perkins household. The boy's heart
gave a jump up into his throat. The
old minister knew everything. The
minister could even tell him what to
write in his composition if he dared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
but ask him. He opened his mouth
to form the question, but his tongue
seemed glued in its place, and the head
under the torn hat drooped lower in
embarrassed silence. His troubled face
flushed to the roots of his tow hair,
and he let the Angel of Opportunity
pass him by unchallenged.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly give me one of
those advertising almanacs, Mr. Bowser?"
inquired the parson, when his
packages of tea and sugar had been
secured. "I've misplaced mine, and I
want to ascertain at what hour to-morrow
the moon changes."</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly!" responded
the storekeeper with obliging alacrity,
rubbing his hands together, and stepping
up on a chair to reach the pile
on a shelf overhead. "Help yourself,
sir. I must answer the telephone."</p>

<p>The parson, slowly studying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
moon's phases as he stepped out of the
store, did not notice that he had taken
two almanacs until one fell at his feet.
The boy sprang up to return it, but he
waved it aside with a courtly sweep of
his hand.</p>

<p>"No, my son, I intended to take
but one. Keep it. They are for general
distribution. You will find it full
of useful information. Have you ever
learned anything about the signs of the
Zodiac? Here is Leo. I always take
an especial interest in this sign, because
I happened to be born under it. I'm
the seventh son of a seventh son, born
in the seventh month, and I always
take it as a good omen, seven being
the perfect number. You know the
ancients believed a man's star largely
affected his destiny. You will find
some interesting historical events enumerated
under each month. A good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
almanac is almost as interesting to study
as a good dictionary, my boy. I would
advise you to form a habit of referring
to both of them frequently."</p>

<p>With one of his rare, childlike
smiles the good man passed on, and
Perkins's oldest was left with the
almanac in his hands. For awhile he
studied the signs of the Zodiac, in
puzzled awe, trying to establish a relationship
between them and the man
they surrounded, whose vital organs
were obligingly laid open to public inspection,
regardless of any personal
inconvenience the display might cause
him.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the historical
events. There was one for each day
in the month. On Sunday, the first,
eighteen hundred and ninety-nine, had
occurred the Japanese typhoon. Friday,
the sixth, sixteen hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
twenty, the <i>Mayflower</i> had sailed.
Mahomet's birth had set apart the
eleventh in five hundred and seventy.
The founding of Mormonism, Washington's
Farewell, and the battle of
Marathon were further down the list,
but it was all Greek to Perkins's
oldest. Any one of these items would
have been straw for the parson. Out
of the <i>Mayflower</i>, Mahomet, Mormonism,
or Marathon, each one of them
the outgrowth of some September, he
could have pressed enough literary
brick to build a fair sky-scraping
structure that would have been the
wonder of all who gazed upon it.
This time the boy looked his Angel
of Opportunity in the face and did not
recognise it as such.</p>

<p>The gate clicked across the road and
he turned his head. Miss Anastasia
Dill was going up the path, her arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
full of goldenrod and white and purple
asters. September was a poem to Miss
Anastasia, but the boy looked upon
goldenrod and the starry asters simply
as meadow weeds. The armful of
bloom brought no suggestion to him.
On the morrow Riley Hines would
hand in two pages of allusions to them,
beginning with a quotation from Whittier's
"Autumn Thoughts," and ending
with a couplet from Pope, carefully
copied by Maria Hines from the "Exercises
for Parsing" in the back of her
grammar.</p>

<p>Somebody's supper-horn blew in the
distance, and, grown desperate by
Tommy's long absence and the lateness
of the hour, he took his little
cracked slate from the strap of books
on the floor beside him, and laid it
across his knees. Then with a stubby
pencil that squeaked dismally in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
passage across the slate, he began copying
bodily from the almanac the list
of historical events enumerated therein,
just as they stood, beginning with the
Japanese typhoon on the first, and
ending "<i>Volunteer</i> beat <i>Thistle</i>" on the
thirtieth, eighteen hundred and eighty-seven.</p>

<p>Then he began to copy a few agricultural
notes, inserted as side remarks
for those who relied on their almanacs
as guide-posts to gardening. "Gather
winter squashes now. They keep
better when stored in a warm dry
place. Harvest sugar beets when the
leaves turn yellowish green, etc."</p>

<p>He was bending painfully over this
task when a shadow fell across his
slate, and, looking up, he saw the old
miller looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Doing your sums?" he asked, with
a friendly smile. "Let's see if you do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
them the way I was taught when I
was a lad." He held out his hand for
the slate. There had been a bond of
sympathy between the two ever since
Christmas eve, when a certain pair of
skates had changed owners, and now,
although the boy's voice trembled almost
out of his control, he managed
to stammer out the reply that he was
trying to write a composition.</p>

<p>The old man looked from the
straggling lines on the slate, then at
the open almanac, then down at the
boy's troubled face, and understood.
Drawing a chair across the porch he
sat down beside him, and, catching the
furtive, scared side-glance cast in his
direction, he plunged at once into a
story.</p>

<p>It was about a shepherd boy who
went out to fight a giant, and the king
insisted on lending him his armour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
But he couldn't fight in the heavy
helmet and the coat of mail. The
shield was in his way, and the spear
more than he could lift. So he threw it
aside, and going down to a little brook,
chose five small pebbles, worn smooth
by the running water. And with these
in his hand, and only the simple sling
he was accustomed to use every day, he
went out against the Philistine giant,
and slew him in the first round.</p>

<p>Perkins's oldest wondered what the
story had to do with his composition.
He wasn't looking for a personal application.
He had not been brought up at
Sunday schools and kindergartens. But
all of a sudden he realised that the
miller meant him; that his depending
on Tommy, or the customers, or the
almanac, to furnish him ideas, was like
going out in Saul's armour, and that
he could only come to failure in that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
because it wouldn't fit him; that he
could hit the mark the little schoolmistress
had in mind for him, only
with the familiar sling-shot of his own
common every-day personal experiences.</p>

<p>Maybe the old miller recognised
that it was a crisis in the little fellow's
life, for he stayed beside him with
helpful hints and questions, until the
slate was full. When he carried it
home in the gloaming it no longer
bore the items from the almanac.
There were other remarks straggling
across it, not so well expressed, perhaps,
but plainly original. They were
to the effect that September is the
month you've got to go back to school
when you don't want to, 'cos it's the
nicest time of all to stay out-doors,
neither too hot nor too cold. There's
lots of apples then, and it's the minister's
birthday. He's the seventh son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a seventh son, and Dick Wiggins says
if you're that you can pick Wahoo
berries in the dark of the moon and
make med'cine out of them, that will
cure the bone-break fever every time,
when nothing else in the world will.
Then followed several items of information
that he had discovered for
himself, in his prowls through the
September woods, about snakes and
tree-toads, as to their habits at that
season of the year. It closed with a suggestive
allusion to the delights of sucking
cider from the bung of a barrel
through a straw.</p>

<p>Next day the little schoolmistress
shook her head over the composition
that Riley Hines handed in, and laid
it aside with a hopeless sigh. She
recognised too plainly the hand of
Maria in its construction. The sentiments
expressed therein were as foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to Riley's nature as they would have
been to a woodchuck's. She took up
Tommy Bowser's. Alas, four-syllabled
words were not in Tommy's daily
vocabulary, nor were the elegant sentences
under his name within the
power of his composition. Plainly it
was the work of a plagiarist.</p>

<p>She went through the pile slowly,
and then wrote on the blackboard as
she had promised, the names of the
ten whose work was the best and most
original. It was then that Perkins's
oldest had the surprise of his life, for
lo! his name, like Abou-ben-Adhem's,
"led all the rest."</p>

<p>Again the Cross-Roads had taught
him more than the school,&mdash;to depend
on the resources to which nature had
adapted him, and never again to attempt

even though it be a king's.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter XII</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was Cy Akers who carried the
news to the schoolhouse, galloping
his old sorrel up to the open door
just before the bell tapped for afternoon
dismissal. He did not dismount, but
drawing rein, leaned forward in his
saddle, waiting for the little schoolmistress
to step down from the desk to
the doorstep. The rows of waiting
children craned their necks anxiously,
but only those nearest the door heard
his message.</div>

<p>"Mr. Asa Holmes died this morning,"
he said. "The funeral is set for
to-morrow afternoon at four, and you
can announce to the children that there
won't be any school. The trustees
thought it would be only proper to
close out of respect for him, as he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
on the school board over thirty years,
and has done so much for the community.
He's one of the old landmarks,
you might say, about the last of
the old pioneers, and everybody will
want to go."</p>

<p>Before she could recover from the
suddenness of the announcement the
rider was gone, and she was left looking
out across the October fields with
a lonely sense of personal loss, although
her acquaintance with the old miller
had extended over only two short
school terms.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the measured
tramp of feet over the worn door-sill
began, and forty children passed out
into the mellow sunshine of the late
autumn afternoon. They went quietly
at first, awed by the tender, reverent
words in which the little schoolmistress
had given them the message to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
home. But once outside, the pent-up
enthusiasm over their unexpected holiday,
and the mere joy of being alive
and free on such a day sent them rushing
down the road pell-mell, shouting
and swinging their dinner-pails as they
ran.</p>

<p>A shade of annoyance crossed the
teacher's face as she stood watching
from the doorstep. She wished she
had cautioned them not to be so noisy,
for she knew that their shouts could
be plainly heard in the old house
whose gables she could see through a
clump of cedars, farther down the
road. It was standing with closed
blinds now, and she had a feeling that
the laughing voices floating across to it
must strike harshly across its profound
silence.</p>

<p>But presently her face brightened as
she watched the children running on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in the sunshine, in the joy of their
emancipation. Part of a poem she
had read that morning came to her.
She had thought when she read it that
it was a beautiful way to look upon
death, and now it bore a new significance,
and she whispered it to herself:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Why should it be a wrench to leave this wooden bench?<br />
Why not with happy shout, run home when school is out?'<br />
</div>

<p>"That's the way the old miller has
gone," she said, softly. "His lessons
all learned and his tasks all done&mdash;so
well done, too, that he has nothing to
regret. I'm glad that I didn't stop the
children. I am sure that's the way he
would want them to go. Dear old
man! He was always a boy at heart."</p>

<p>She turned the key in the door behind
her presently, and started down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the road to Mrs. Powers's, where she
boarded. In every fence corner the
sumachs flamed blood-red, and across
the fields, where purple shadows trailed
their royal lengths behind every shock
of corn, the autumn woodlands massed
their gold and crimson against the
sunset sky. She walked slowly, loath
to reach the place where she must go
indoors.</p>

<p>The Perkins home lay in her way,
and as she passed, Mrs. Perkins with a
baby on her hip, and a child clinging
to her skirts, leaned over the gate to
speak to her.</p>

<p>"Isn't it sad," the woman exclaimed,
grasping eagerly at this chance to discuss
every incident of the death and
illness, with that love for detail always
to be found in country districts
where happenings are few and interests
are strong.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"They sent for the family Tuesday
when he had the stroke, but he couldn't
speak to them when they got here.
They said he seemed to recognise Miss
Polly, and smiled when she took his
hand. She seemed to be his favourite,
and they say she's taking it mighty
hard&mdash;harder than any of the rest.
It's a pity he couldn't have left 'em all
some last message. I think it's always a
comfort to remember one's dying words
when as good a person as Mr. Holmes
goes. And it's always so nice when
they happen to be appropriate, so's they
can be put on the tombstone afterward.
I remember my Aunt Maria worked
my grandfather's last words into a
sampler, with an urn and weeping-willow-tree.
She had it framed in
black and hung in the parlour, and
everybody who came to the house
admired it. It's a pity that the miller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
couldn't have left some last word to
each of 'em."</p>

<p>"I don't think it was necessary,"
said the girl, turning away with a
choke in her voice, as the eloquent
face of the old man seemed to rise up
before her. "His whole life speaks for
him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Perkins looked after the retreating
figure regretfully, as the jaunty
sailor hat disappeared behind a tall
hedge. "I wish she hadn't been in
such a hurry," she sighed, shifting the
baby to the other hip. "I would
have liked to ask her if she's heard
who the pall-bearers are to be."</p>

<p>At the turn in the road the little
schoolmistress looked up to see Miss
Anastasia Dill leaning over her gate.
She had just heard the news, and there
were tears in her pale blue eyes.</p>

<p>"And Polly's wedding cards were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to have been sent out this next week!"
she exclaimed after their first words of
greeting. "The poor child told me
so herself when she was here in August
on a visit. 'Miss Anastasia,' she said
to me, 'I'm not going abroad for my
honeymoon, as all my family want
me to do. I'm going to bring Jack
back here to the old homestead where
grandfather's married life began. Somehow
it was so ideal, so nearly perfect,
that I have a feeling that maybe the
mantle of that old romance will fall on
our shoulders. Besides, Jack has never
seen grandfather, and I tell him it's as
much of an education to know such
a grand old man as it is to go through
Yale. So we're coming in October.
The woods will have on all their gala
colours then, and I'll be the happiest
bride the sun ever shone on, unless it
was my grandmother Polly.' And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to think," added Miss Anastasia, tearfully,
"none of those plans can come
to pass. It's bad luck to put off a
wedding. Oh, I feel so sorry for
her!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is an undefined note of pathos
in a country funeral that is never
reached in any other. The little schoolmistress
felt it as she walked up the path
to the old house behind the cedars.
The front porch was full of men, who,
dressed in their unaccustomed best,
had the uneasy appearance of having
come upon a Sunday in the middle of
the week. Their heavy boots tiptoed
clumsily through the hall, with a painful
effort to go silently, as one by one
the neighbours passed into the old sitting-room
and out again. The room
across the hall had been filled with
rows of chairs, and the women who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
came first were sitting there in a
deep silence, broken only by a cough
now and then, a hoarse whisper or a
rustle, as some one moved to make
room for a newcomer.</p>

<p>It was a sombre assembly, for every
one wore whatever black her wardrobe
afforded, and many funeral occasions
had left an accumulation of mourning
millinery in every house in the neighbourhood.
But the limp crape veils
and black gloves and pall-like cashmere
shawls were all congregated in
the dimly lighted parlour. In the old
sitting-room it was as cheerful and
homelike as ever, save for the still
form in the centre.</p>

<p>Through an open window the western
sun streamed into the big, hospitable
room, across the bright home-made
rag carpet. The old clock in the
corner ticked with the placid, steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
stroke that had never failed or faltered,
in any vicissitude of the generations
for which it had marked the changes.
No fire blazed on the old hearthstone
that had warmed the hearts as well as
the hands of the whole countryside on
many a cheerful occasion. But a great
bough of dogwood, laid across the shining
andirons, filled the space with coral
berries that glowed like live embers as
the sun stole athwart them.</p>

<p>"Oh, if the old room could only
speak!" thought Miss Anastasia, when
her turn came to pass reverently in for
a last look at the peaceful face. "There
would be no need of man's eulogy."</p>

<p>But man's eulogy was added presently,
when the old minister came in
and took his place beside the coffin
of his lifelong friend and neighbour.
The men outside the porch closed in
around the windows to listen. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
women in the back rows of chairs in
the adjoining room leaned forward
eagerly. Those farthest away caught
only a faltering sentence now and
then.</p>

<p>"A hospitality as warm as his own
hearthstone, as wide as his broad acres....
No man can point to him and say
he ever knowingly hurt or hindered a
fellow creature.... He never measured
out to any man a scant bushel.
Be it grain or good-will, it was ever an
overflowing measure...." But those
who could not hear all that was said
could make the silent places eloquent
with their own recollections, for he
had taken a father's interest in them
all, and manifested it by a score of
kindly deeds, too kindly to ever be
forgotten.</p>

<p>It was a perfect autumn day, sunny
and golden and still, save for the patter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of dropping nuts and the dry rustle of
fallen leaves. A purple haze rested on
the distant horizon like the bloom on
a ripened grape. Down through the
orchard, when the simple service was
over, they carried their old friend to the
family burying-ground, and, although
voices had choked, and eyes overflowed
before, there was neither sob nor tear,
when the light of the sunset struck
across the low mound, heaped with its
covering of glowing autumn leaves.
For if grief has no part in the sunset
glory that ends the day, or in the perfect
fulness of the autumn time, then
it must indeed stand hushed, when a
life comes both to its sunset and its
harvest, in such royal fashion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That evening at the Cross-Roads,
Bowser lighted the first fire of the season
in the rusty old stove, for the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
was chilly. One by one the men accustomed
to gather around it dropped
in and took their usual places. The
event of the day was all that was spoken
of.</p>

<p>"Do you remember what he said
last Thanksgiving, nearly a year ago?"
asked Bowser. "It came back to me
as I stood and looked at him to-day,
and if I'd never believed in immortality
before, I'd 'a' had to have believed in it
then. The words seemed to fairly
shine out of his face. He said '<i>The
best comes after the harvest, when the
wheat goes to make up blood and muscle
and brain; when it's raised to a higher
order of life in man. And it's the same
with me. At eighty-five, when it looks as
if I'd about reached the end, I've come
to believe that "the best is yet to be.</i>"'"</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and Cy
Akers said, slowly, "Somehow I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
feel that he is dead. Seems as if he'd
just gone away a while. But Lord!
how we're going to miss him here at
the store."</p>

<p>"No, don't say that!" exclaimed
Bud Hines, with more emotion than
he had ever been known to show before.
"Say, how we're going to feel
him! I can't get him out of my
mind. Every time I turn around,
most, seems to me I can hear him
laugh, and say, 'Don't cross your
bridge till you come to it, Bud.' That
saying of his rings in my ears every
time I get in the dumps. Seems like
he could set the calendar straight for
us, all the year around. The winters
wasn't so cold or the summers so hard
to pull through, looking at life through
his eyes."</p>

<p>Perkins's oldest crept up unnoticed.
He added no word, but deep in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
heart lay an impression that all the
years to come could never erase; the
remembrance of a kindly old man who
had given him a new gospel, in that
one phrase, "A brother to Santa
Claus;" who had taught him to go
out against his Philistines with simple
directness of aim and whatever lay at
hand; who had left behind him the
philosophy of a cheerful optimist, and
the example of a sweet simple life,
unswerving in its loyalty to duty and
to truth.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Over in the old homestead, Polly,
standing in the firelight, fair and slender
in her black gown, looked up at the
tall young fellow beside her, and placed
two little books in his hands. The
old house was not her only heritage.
The little atlas of the heavens was hers
also. Standing there in the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
where the beloved presence seemed to
have left its benediction, Polly told the
story of the love that had outlived
Death. Then across the yellowed
page of the old grammar where the
faded violets lay, two hands met in
the same sure clasp that had joined the
souls of those older lovers, who somewhere
beyond the stars were still repeating
the old conjugation&mdash;"we
love&mdash;<i>for ever!</i>"</p>

<p>The stories in Mr. Roberts's new collection are the strongest
and best he has ever written.</p>

<p>He has largely taken for his subjects those animals rarely
met with in books, whose lives are spent "In the Silences,"
where they are the supreme rulers. Mr. Roberts has written
of them sympathetically, as always, but with fine regard
for the scientific truth.</p>

place. He is the most literary, as well as the most imaginative

</div>

<p>The Lady of the Blue Motor is an audacious heroine
who drove her mysterious car at breakneck speed. Her
plea for assistance in an adventure promising more than a
spice of danger could not of course be disregarded by any
gallant fellow motorist. Mr. Paternoster's hero rose
promptly to the occasion. Across France they tore and
across the English Channel. There, the escapade past, he
lost her.</p>

<p>Mr. Paternoster, however, is generous, and allows the
reader to follow their separate adventures until the Lady of
the Blue Motor is found again and properly vindicated of
all save womanly courage and affection. A unique romance,
one continuous exciting series of adventure.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Stephens has put into his new book, "Clementina's
Highwayman," the finest qualities of plot, construction, and
literary finish.</p>

<p>The story is laid in the mid-Georgian period. It is a
dashing, sparkling, vivacious comedy, with a heroine as
lovely and changeable as an April day, and a hero all ardor
and daring.</p>

<p>The exquisite quality of Mr. Stephens's literary style
clothes the story in a rich but delicate word-fabric; and

<p>The love-story of Otto III., the boy emperor, and Stephania,
wife of the Senator Crescentius of Rome, has
already been made the basis of various German poems and
plays.</p>

<p>Mr. Gallizier has used it for the main theme of "The
Sorceress of Rome," the second book of his trilogy of
romances on the medival life of Italy. In detail and
finish the book is a brilliant piece of work, describing
clearly an exciting and strenuous period. It possesses the
same qualities as "Castel del Monte," of which the <i>Chicago
Record Herald</i> said: "There is color, there is sumptuous
word-painting in these pages; the action is terrific at times;
vividness and life are in every part; brilliant descriptions
entertain the reader; mystic scenes and prophecies give a
singular fascination to the tale, which is strong and forceful

</div>

<p>"Hester of the Hills" has a motif unusual in life, and
new in fiction. Its hero, who has only acquired his own
strength and resourcefulness by a lifelong struggle against
constitutional frailty, has come to make the question of
bodily soundness his dominant thought. He resolves to
ensure strong constitutions to his children by marrying a
physically perfect woman. After long search, he finds this
ideal in Hester, the daughter of a "cracker squatter," of
the Ozark Mountains of Missouri. But,&mdash;he forgot to
take into consideration that very vital emotion, love, which
played havoc with his well-laid plans.</p>

<p>It is an ingenious combination of practical realism and
imaginative fiction worked out to a thoroughly delightful
and satisfying climax.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4_ad1" id="Page_4_ad1">[4]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The period of Mr. Smith's story is the beginning of the
eighteenth century, when the shores of the American colonies
were harassed and the seas patrolled by pirates and
buccaneers. These robbed and spoiled, and often seized
and put to death, the sailors and fishers and other humbler
folk, while their leaders claimed friendship alike with Southern
planters and New England merchants,&mdash;with whom
it is said they frequently divided their spoils.</p>

<p>The times were stern and the colonists were hardy, but
they loved as truly and tenderly as in more peaceful days.
Thus, while the hero's adventures with pirates and his search
for their hidden treasure is a record of desperate encounters
and daring deeds, his love-story and his winning of sweet
Mary Vane is in delightful contrast.</p>

</div>

<p>A mysterious murder on a flying express train, a wily
Italian, a charming woman caught in the meshes of circumstantial
evidence, a chivalrous Englishman, and a police
force with a keen nose for the wrong clue, are the ingredients
from which Major Griffiths has concocted a clever, up-to-date
detective story. The book is bright and spirited,
with rapid action, and consistent development which brings
the story to a logical and dramatic ending.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5_ad1" id="Page_5_ad1">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The doings of the Morning Glory Club will furnish genuine
amusement to the reader. Originally formed to "elevate"
the village, it quickly develops into an exchange for
town gossip. It has a saving grace, however, in the person
of motherly Mrs. Stout, the uncultured but sweet-natured
and pure-minded village philosopher, who pours the oil of
her saneness and charity on the troubled waters of discussion
and condemnation.</p>

<p>It is a series of clear and interesting pictures of the humor
of village life.</p>

<p>The success of Mr. Morrison's recent books, "The Green

Hewitt," which has been out of print for a number of years.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Martin Hewitt is the detective
in "The Red Triangle," of whom the <i>New York
Tribune</i> said: "Better than Sherlock Holmes." His adventures
in the London slums were of such a nature that the
<i>Philadelphia North American</i> said: "The reader who has
a grain of fancy or imagination may be defied to lay this
book down once he has begun it until the last word is

<p>A hunting camp on a swampy island in the Florida Everglades
furnishes the background for this present-day tale.</p>

<p>By the murder of one of their number, the secret of
egress from the island is lost, and the campers find themselves
marooned.</p>

<p>Cut off from civilization, conventional veneer soon wears
away. Love, hate, and revenge spring up, and after the
sterner passions have had their sway the man and the woman
are left alone to fulfil their own destiny.</p>

<p>While there is much that is unusual in the plot and its
development, Mr. Hurst has handled his subject with fine
delicacy, and the tale of their love on the beautiful little
island is told with deep sympathy and feeling.</p>

good sea story such as might be expected from the author
of "The Promotion of the Admiral." In "The Flying
Cloud" the waters and the winds are gods personified.
Their every mood and phase are described in words of telling
force. There is no world but the waste of waters.</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts glories and exults in the mystery, the passion,
the strength of the elements, as did the Viking chroniclers
of old. He understands them and loves them and
interprets them as no other writer has heretofore done.
The book is too big for conventional phrases. It needs
Mr. Roberts's own richness of imagery and masterly expression
to describe adequately the word-pictures in this
epic of wind and waves.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1_ad2" id="Page_1_ad2">[1]</a></span></p>

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
